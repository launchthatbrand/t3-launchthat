		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Analyze Current Convex Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analysis of the Convex structure into subtasks for folder structure, file dependencies, API usage patterns, circular dependencies, and 'any' type usage.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and involves multiple analysis steps, making it highly complex. The use of specialized tools and the need for comprehensive documentation further increases its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Backup of Convex Folder",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the backup process into subtasks for selecting a backup tool, performing the backup, and verifying the backup integrity.",
			"reasoning": "While crucial, this task is relatively straightforward with clear steps and common tools available. The main complexity lies in ensuring the backup's completeness and integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Design New Folder Structure Template",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the template design process into subtasks for researching Convex best practices, creating the folder structure, developing a generation script, and documenting the new structure.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires in-depth knowledge of Convex best practices and impacts the entire project structure. The need to create a flexible, scalable template and an automated generation script adds to its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Convex Best Practices",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of best practices into subtasks for error handling, query optimization, caching mechanisms, real-time subscriptions, code review, and performance testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires a deep understanding of Convex, affects the entire codebase, and involves multiple advanced concepts. Ensuring consistent implementation across all features adds to its difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Perform Comprehensive Testing",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the testing process into subtasks for unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, load testing, manual testing, user acceptance testing, and issue resolution.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks due to its comprehensive nature, covering all aspects of the application. It requires diverse testing methodologies, tools, and coordination with stakeholders, making it highly challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Final Cleanup and Optimization",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the cleanup process into subtasks for removing temporary files, optimizing imports, running linters and formatters, final TypeScript compilation, and code review.",
			"reasoning": "While not as complex as some other tasks, this requires attention to detail across the entire codebase. The use of various tools and the need for a final comprehensive review contribute to its moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Legacy .old and .bak Files",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the file removal process into subtasks for identifying target files, creating a removal script, and verifying the cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively simple task with clear objectives. The main considerations are ensuring the correct files are targeted and not removing necessary files, but overall it's straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Update Root Schema File",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the schema update process into subtasks for importing feature schemas, resolving conflicts, implementing module augmentation, applying schema validation, and testing the consolidated schema.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need to integrate multiple feature schemas without conflicts. Ensuring type safety and avoiding circular dependencies adds to its difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Update Project Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation update into subtasks for updating README.md, creating API documentation, updating developer guides, and reviewing/testing documentation.",
			"reasoning": "While time-consuming, this task is moderately complex. The main challenges lie in ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness across all documentation, but it doesn't require deep technical problem-solving."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Update Application Code for New API Paths",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the code update process into subtasks for identifying affected code areas, creating update patterns, applying updates (possibly with automation), testing updated code, and resolving any issues.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to its wide-ranging impact across the application. The potential for breaking changes and the need for careful testing contribute to its difficulty. The use of automation tools adds some complexity but also aids in managing the scale of changes."
