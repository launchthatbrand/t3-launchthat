# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop UI components for sorting and filtering feed content by various criteria.
# Details:
Implement a `FeedFilters` React component with the following features:

1. Filter Options:
   - Content type filters (posts, shares, media, etc.)
   - Date range selector
   - Source filters (modules: blog, courses, groups, etc.)
   - Author filters (following, all users, etc.)

2. Sort Options:
   - Newest first
   - Most popular (by engagement)
   - Most relevant (personalized)

3. UI Elements:
   - Filter dropdown/modal
   - Active filter chips/badges
   - Clear all filters button
   - Save filter preset option

4. State Management:
   - URL parameter synchronization
   - Filter state persistence
   - Integration with feed queries

5. Responsive Design:
   - Compact view for mobile
   - Expanded view for desktop
   - Accessible controls

Implement the component to work seamlessly with the FeedStream component. Ensure filters are applied efficiently without unnecessary re-fetching.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each filter option works correctly
2. Verify sort options change the feed order
3. Test URL parameter synchronization
4. Verify filter state persists correctly
5. Test responsive behavior
6. Verify accessibility of filter controls
7. Test performance with various filter combinations
