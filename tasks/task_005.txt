# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Feed Stream Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a reusable React component for displaying the feed with infinite scrolling, loading states, and error handling.
# Details:
Implement a `FeedStream` React component with the following features:

1. Props:
   - `feedType`: 'universal', 'personalized', 'group', 'profile'
   - `targetId`: ID of group or profile when applicable
   - `limit`: Number of items to load per page
   - `filters`: Object containing active filters

2. Features:
   - Fetch initial feed data using appropriate API query
   - Implement infinite scrolling using Intersection Observer
   - Show loading states during initial load and pagination
   - Handle empty states with appropriate messaging
   - Implement error handling with retry options
   - Support real-time updates using Convex subscriptions
   - Optimize rendering for large lists using virtualization

3. Styling:
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes
   - Consistent with platform design system
   - Accessible focus states and keyboard navigation
   - Smooth animations for loading and new content

Use React Query or similar for data fetching and caching. Implement proper TypeScript types for all props and state.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test component rendering
2. Test infinite scrolling behavior
3. Verify loading states display correctly
4. Test error handling and retry functionality
5. Verify real-time updates work
6. Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
7. Verify accessibility with screen readers
