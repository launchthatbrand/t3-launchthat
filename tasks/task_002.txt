# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Feed API Queries
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the backend API endpoints for retrieving different types of feeds (universal, personalized, group-specific, and user profile).
# Details:
Create the following Convex query functions:

1. `getUniversalFeed(limit, cursor)`:
   - Retrieve public content from all modules
   - Sort by creation date (newest first)
   - Support pagination with cursor-based approach
   - Include reaction counts and comment counts

2. `getPersonalizedFeed(userId, limit, cursor)`:
   - Filter content based on user's subscriptions
   - Include content from followed users, topics, and groups
   - Sort by relevance algorithm (combination of recency and engagement)
   - Support pagination

3. `getGroupFeed(groupId, limit, cursor)`:
   - Retrieve content specific to a group
   - Filter by visibility permissions
   - Sort by creation date
   - Support pagination

4. `getUserProfileFeed(profileId, limit, cursor)`:
   - Get content created by a specific user
   - Filter by visibility permissions
   - Sort by creation date
   - Support pagination

5. `getFeedItem(feedItemId)`:
   - Get a single feed item by ID with all associated data

Implement proper access control to ensure users can only see content they have permission to view.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for each query function
2. Test pagination works correctly
3. Verify sorting order is correct
4. Test permission filters work as expected
5. Benchmark query performance with large datasets
6. Test edge cases like empty results
