# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Parent-Child Relationship Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement logic for handling order (parent) and line item (child) relationships during synchronization with Monday.com.
# Details:
Implement specialized logic for parent-child relationships with these features:
1. Order creation as parent items in Monday.com
2. Line item creation as subitems under the parent
3. Relationship maintenance during synchronization
4. Status propagation between parent and children

The implementation should:
- Create parent items for orders in Monday.com
- Create subitems for each line item in the order
- Maintain relationship integrity during updates
- Handle status changes appropriately
- Support bidirectional synchronization of the relationship

Extend the existing pull and push synchronization logic to handle these relationships.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for parent-child relationship handling. Test order creation with line items. Verify relationship integrity during updates. Test status propagation between parent and children. Verify bidirectional synchronization works correctly for complex order structures.
