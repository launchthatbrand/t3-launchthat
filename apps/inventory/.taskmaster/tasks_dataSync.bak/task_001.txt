# Task ID: 1
# Title: Extend Convex Schema for Monday.com Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create necessary tables and fields in Convex schema to support Monday.com integration configuration and synchronization metadata.
# Details:
Create the following tables in Convex:
1. `mondayIntegration` - Stores API key, workspace ID, connection status, and last sync timestamp
2. `mondayBoardMappings` - Maps Convex tables to Monday.com boards with sync direction settings
3. `mondayColumnMappings` - Maps Convex fields to Monday.com columns with transformation rules
4. `mondaySyncLogs` - Records sync operations, affected records, and errors

Add fields to existing tables:
- Add `mondayItemId` to relevant tables (products, orders, etc.)
- Add `lastSyncedAt` timestamp field
- Add `syncStatus` field (enum: synced, pending, error)

Implement appropriate indexes for efficient querying.

# Test Strategy:
Validate schema creation with Convex CLI. Write unit tests to ensure tables have correct fields and relationships. Test indexes with sample queries to verify performance.
