# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Column Mapping Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the UI for mapping Convex fields to Monday.com columns, including data type handling and validation.
# Details:
Create a React component for the column mapping interface with these features:
1. Two-column layout showing Convex fields and Monday.com columns
2. Dropdown selectors for mapping fields to columns
3. Data type indicators and validation warnings
4. Required field validation
5. Save/cancel buttons for configuration changes

The interface should:
- Load available fields from the Convex schema
- Load columns from the selected Monday.com board
- Show data type compatibility warnings
- Validate that required fields are mapped
- Store mappings in the `mondayColumnMappings` table

Implement a modal or dedicated page that opens when 'Configure Columns' is clicked for a specific board mapping.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests for the column mapping interface. Test field loading and display. Verify mapping selection and storage. Test data type validation logic. Ensure required field validation works correctly. Test save/cancel functionality.
