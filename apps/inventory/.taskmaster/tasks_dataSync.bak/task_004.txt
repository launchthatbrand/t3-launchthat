# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Board Mapping Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the UI for mapping Convex tables to Monday.com boards, including sync direction controls and board metadata display.
# Details:
Develop a React component for the board mapping interface with these features:
1. List of available Convex tables with Monday.com board selectors
2. Enable/disable toggles for each mapping
3. Sync direction controls (pull/push checkboxes)
4. Board metadata display (columns, item count)
5. 'Configure Columns' button for each mapping

The interface should allow admins to:
- Select which Convex tables to sync with Monday.com
- Choose a specific Monday.com board for each table
- Configure whether each mapping supports pull, push, or both
- View basic information about the selected board

Store mapping configurations in the `mondayBoardMappings` table.

# Test Strategy:
Write component tests for the mapping interface. Test the selection and storage of board mappings. Verify that enable/disable toggles work correctly. Test sync direction controls update the configuration properly. Verify board metadata is displayed correctly.
