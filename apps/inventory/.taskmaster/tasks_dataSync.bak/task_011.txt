# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Build the user interface for viewing and managing synchronization logs, including filtering and error details.
# Details:
Develop a React component for the sync logs interface with these features:
1. Filterable list of sync operations
2. Details view showing affected records
3. Error explanations with retry options
4. Export logs functionality

The interface should:
- Display a paginated list of sync operations
- Allow filtering by date, type, status, etc.
- Show detailed information for selected operations
- Provide clear error explanations
- Allow retrying failed operations
- Support exporting logs for troubleshooting

Implement appropriate loading states and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests for the sync logs interface. Test list display and pagination. Verify filtering functionality works correctly. Test details view displays complete information. Verify retry functionality for failed operations. Test log export functionality.
