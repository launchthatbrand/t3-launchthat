# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Rule Configuration Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Build the user interface for configuring event-based synchronization rules and column value mappings.
# Details:
Develop a React component for the rule configuration interface with these features:
1. Rule creation form with event type selection
2. Condition builder for trigger criteria
3. Action configuration for sync operations
4. Column value mapping interface
5. Rule testing and validation

The interface should:
- Allow selecting trigger events from a predefined list
- Support building conditions with a user-friendly interface
- Configure actions to take when conditions are met
- Map status values between systems
- Validate rules for logical consistency

Implement appropriate form validation and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests for the rule configuration interface. Test rule creation with various event types. Verify condition builder works correctly. Test action configuration options. Verify status mapping functionality. Test rule validation logic with valid and invalid configurations.
