# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Conflict Detection and Resolution
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop mechanisms for detecting and resolving conflicts during bidirectional synchronization.
# Details:
Implement conflict detection and resolution with these features:
1. Change detection with timestamp comparison
2. Conflict identification for concurrent changes
3. Resolution strategies (latest wins, manual resolution)
4. Conflict logging and notification

The system should:
- Detect when the same record has been modified in both systems
- Identify specific fields with conflicts
- Apply configured resolution strategy
- Log conflicts for review
- Notify admins of unresolved conflicts

Implement a conflict resolution interface that allows admins to manually resolve conflicts when needed.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for conflict detection and resolution. Test change detection with concurrent modifications. Verify conflict identification is accurate. Test different resolution strategies. Verify conflict logging and notification functionality.
