# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Connection Management UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the user interface for managing the Monday.com API connection, including API key setup, workspace selection, and connection testing.
# Details:
Develop a React component for the connection management UI with the following elements:
1. API key input field with validation
2. Workspace dropdown selector (populated after API key validation)
3. Connection status indicator showing current state
4. Test connection button that verifies access
5. Last synchronized timestamp display

Implement form validation for the API key field. Store the API key securely in the Convex database. Add loading states for API operations. Display appropriate error messages for connection issues.

The component should be placed in the admin settings under a new 'Data Sync' section.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests with React Testing Library. Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs. Mock API responses for connection testing. Verify proper error handling and display. Test that API key is stored correctly in Convex.
