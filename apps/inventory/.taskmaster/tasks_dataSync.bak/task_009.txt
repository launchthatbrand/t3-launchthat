# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create Synchronization Control UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the user interface for manually triggering synchronization operations and displaying progress.
# Details:
Develop a React component for the synchronization control UI with these features:
1. Manual 'Pull from Monday' and 'Push to Monday' buttons for each mapping
2. Global sync buttons for all enabled mappings
3. Sync progress indicators
4. Confirmation dialogs for operations that might overwrite data
5. Success/error notifications

The interface should:
- Allow triggering sync operations for individual mappings
- Support bulk synchronization of all enabled mappings
- Show progress during synchronization
- Provide clear feedback on operation results
- Warn users before potentially destructive operations

Implement appropriate loading states and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Create component tests for the synchronization control UI. Test button functionality and confirmation dialogs. Verify progress indicators update correctly. Test success and error notifications. Verify that sync operations are triggered correctly.
