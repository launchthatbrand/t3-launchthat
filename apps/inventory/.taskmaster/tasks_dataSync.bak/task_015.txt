# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance for Large Datasets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Improve synchronization performance for large datasets through batching, pagination, and efficient algorithms.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations with these features:
1. Efficient change detection algorithms
2. Request batching for Monday.com API
3. Pagination handling for large datasets
4. Incremental synchronization
5. Background processing for large operations

The optimizations should:
- Minimize API calls to Monday.com
- Efficiently process large datasets
- Support incremental synchronization
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Provide progress feedback during long operations

Implement benchmarking and monitoring to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

# Test Strategy:
Create performance tests with large datasets. Measure synchronization time before and after optimizations. Verify batching reduces API calls. Test pagination with very large datasets. Verify incremental synchronization works correctly. Test rate limit handling under high load.
