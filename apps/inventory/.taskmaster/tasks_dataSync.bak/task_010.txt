# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Synchronization Logging System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive logging system for tracking synchronization operations, errors, and affected records.
# Details:
Implement a synchronization logging system with these features:
1. Detailed logging of all sync operations
2. Error tracking with context information
3. Record-level change tracking
4. Sync metrics collection

The logging system should:
- Record start and end of each sync operation
- Log details of records created, updated, or with errors
- Store error messages and stack traces
- Track performance metrics (time taken, records processed)
- Support querying and filtering of logs

Store logs in the `mondaySyncLogs` table with appropriate indexing for efficient querying.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the logging system. Verify that all sync operations are properly logged. Test error logging with various error scenarios. Verify metrics collection is accurate. Test log querying and filtering functionality.
