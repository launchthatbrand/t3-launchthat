# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Push Synchronization Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core logic for exporting data from Convex to Monday.com, including change detection and data transformation.
# Details:
Implement the push synchronization logic with these components:
1. Query to fetch records from Convex based on mapping configuration
2. Change detection algorithm to identify new or updated records
3. Data transformation based on column mappings
4. Monday.com API calls to create or update items
5. Sync status and timestamp tracking

The push operation should:
- Query Convex for records based on mapping configuration
- Determine which records are new or updated since last sync
- Transform data according to column mappings
- Create new items or update existing ones in Monday.com
- Store returned Monday.com IDs with Convex records
- Update sync status and timestamp
- Log the operation details

Implement batching for efficient API usage and error handling for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the push synchronization logic. Test change detection with various scenarios. Verify data transformation works correctly for different data types. Test batching with large datasets. Verify error handling with simulated API failures. Test sync status and timestamp updates.
