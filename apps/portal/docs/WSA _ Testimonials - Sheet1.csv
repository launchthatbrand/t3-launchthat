Gabrielle Kendall,gabrielle.kendall.00@gmail.com,"Hello,>> I have been a part of Wall Street Academy for a month now. As I believe the impact of what the business/platform will be is life changing as time progresses. I can speak to what I have seen and experienced in this short period of time. For Wall Street Academy as the educational platform it is is amazing. Being able to go through the basics and seeing the journey of improvement from Quillan and his students over the years to trading and training has been great to watch. I am 50+ webinars in, while also completing the phases leading up to this point. A lot of the questions/struggles I have with trading are there. It is laid out to follow and understand that there are so many others that have had or have the exact same questions I do. It makes me feel like I am not alone even if it was from 5+ years ago. Being able to reapply directly and see the way to look at the market every day as I go through the training and build the muscle memory to understand exactly what I am looking at. I appreciate the thought to keep the journey because it shares a story that is worth listening to. Overall Wall Street Academy means that I can improve exponentially and prepare for whatever that may look like in the years to come.>> As for the 6 month mentorship program, I appreciate not only the time but the effort of how everyone is trying to help each other. It shows the community that has been built and helps someone like me be able to ask my questions and get a breakdown to help grow. It has helped me with starting to build my confidence in trading and also wanting to speak up in the discord and on the calls. Especially with being an introvert and would rather be in the background but being in the background means my growth will be stunted if I don't speak up and ask the questions while people are willing to help and deep dive into the charts.>> As new as I am, it is not lost on me on what could become and WSA has a great foundation to prepare for what comes next. Quillan is appreciated for his time and so is the WSA group as a whole. It helps remove barriers that people can face while being alone while also building a community with people you would never come in contact with without it. I look forward to reflecting back to this moment, this choice and saying I would do it all over again.>> Thanks,Gabby","Hello,

Reginald Rhodes,reginaldbrhodes@gmail.com,"Hello,>> WSA has completely transformed the way I approach the markets. Before joining, I often found myself unsure about trade entries and exits, but the mentorship and clear methodology taught through WSA gave me the confidence I was missing. Understanding market structure became second nature, and that clarity has allowed me to hold trades to my take-profit levels with far less hesitation. It's not just a course—it's a mindset shift. WSA helped me stop second-guessing and start trading with purpose. I know I still have work to do to become the 6-figure profitable trader I know I'm meant to be but I'm confident I'll get there with WSA's support.>> Thanks,Reginald","Hello,

I first took Cue's in person course several years ago and admittedly I wasn't very prepared.
I had gone through the course quickly a couple days before and was a little overwhelmed.
Wall Street Academy has allowed me over the years to improve my trading more than I could ever describe.
The lessons are always available to review, fine tune, and improve my trading...and I find that each time I review a lesson or video I learn something new.
Also there is just a wealth of knowledge from all of the webinars, confluence videos, and everything else Cue has provided over the years.
As Cue's style and approach to the markets has evolved he has shared that with all of us through WSA...we don't have to reinvent the wheel so to speak and are able to take advantage of his own growth and knowledge.
I also need to say that access to the Facebook group, and now Discord, has been invaluable.
It truly is a community of traders who are eager to learn, grow, and help each other.
Countless times I have reached out to other members to ask questions or to seek clarification in an effort to improve...everyone has always been kind, helpful, encouraging, and supportive.
I have learned so much from other members of the group in addition to what I have learned from Cue...I don't know where else you could find this kind of community, and Cue has really created something unique and special with WSA.
I am now a funded trader and consistently working to improve my skills, grow my accounts, and increase my capital.
Trading has gone from a dream, to a hobby, and now to a viable skill to provide income for the rest of my life...a path which will lead to my ultimate goal of not only financial freedom, but ""time freedom"" as well.
I am so grateful for WSA.
Thank you Cue, and thank you everyone in the group...this has been life changing for me.
THANKS!

Devyn Bell,devyn.bell5@gmail.com,"Wall Street Academy means more to my trading career than anything else. I knew nothing about forex when I first discovered WSA and it turned me into a competent trader. There are several key lessons I will never forget such as Timeframe correlation, confluence, and being on the charts every f’ing day to get better. I was first introduced to WSA through a random person that I met at a real estate conference. I noticed that before the event started he had some charts up so I started conversation and he told me that he averaged about $500/day. I thought that was big money at the time and felt that if I could find his mentor I could do the same thing. That's when he put me onto Cue’s Instagram and that was it. That was back in 2020, I've learned so much from WSA and Cue. Definitely has the biggest impact on how I view the market. I can still hear Cue’s voice preaching key points when I'm reviewing my trading rules and checklist (no diddly).

Unlike the subscription based trading communities, cue was very focused on teaching and making every student independent when it comes to chart analysis and trade execution rather than just doing the work for the traders. I believe giving out signals affects the students capacity and zeal to learn and also confidence in trading.Another thing that caught my eyes was the lifestyle(car collection in particular). As a car enthusiast myself seeing cue’s car collection and lifestyle sparked a sense of hope that I once lost being part of the other trading communities.

And those habits haven’t just been damaging to my trading journey but also damaging to my life. It showed me that my demeanor WILL show up on the charts. I realized that I didn’t have as much patience as I thought. It showed me that I don’t stick to the plan, that I’m impulsive and that’s where the real CHARTING began. Wall Street Academy, CUE helped exposed these things so I could grow!>> Growing up I wanted to go to college for music but my parents told me that it was a hobby and I needed to go for something real. So In high school I began dual enrollment and began student teaching and taking college courses to be able to teach right out of high school. After graduating and having my credentials I went to college to give it a try. After the 1st semester due to an eye disease undiagnosed I had to go on medical and have two eye surgeries on both eyes. As a result I wear glasses contacts everyday that insurance doesn’t cover and cost $4000 a pair. During covid I was introduced to forex through IML academy and it was HORRIBLE. Nobody could teach me anything but to RECRUIT. I’ve invested over $10,000 doing it the WRONG WAY.>> Now at age 24 , being a first time husband, being a first time girl dad, and being a teacher… financially I have to create stability and security.

I realized that I didn’t have as much patience as I thought. It showed me that I don’t stick to the plan, that I’m impulsive and that’s where the real CHARTING began. Wall Street Academy, CUE helped exposed these things so I could grow!
Growing up I wanted to go to college for music but my parents told me that it was a hobby and I needed to go for something real. So In high school I began dual enrollment and began student teaching and taking college courses to be able to teach right out of high school. After graduating and having my credentials I went to college to give it a try. After the 1st semester due to an eye disease undiagnosed I had to go on medical and have two eye surgeries on both eyes. As a result I wear glasses contacts everyday that insurance doesn’t cover and cost $4000 a pair. During covid I was introduced to forex through IML academy and it was HORRIBLE. Nobody could teach me anything but to RECRUIT. I’ve invested over $10,000 doing it the WRONG WAY.
Now at age 24 , being a first time husband, being a first time girl dad, and being a teacher… financially I have to create stability and security. It is on me to move us out of my parents basement… Many times I have wanted to quit but I honestly love the ART of trading and NOW I have a family depending on me. That is why I WONT QUIT and I will take anything that helps me better myself!",Y

I joined Wallstreet Academy about 45 days ago. It's been a life changing experience. Cue has clarified many of the concerns I had that made me a gambler instead of a consistent and profitable trader. I enjoy the training sessions (chart & chill), because they are laid back, open dialogue and informative.
Cue provides technical and fundamental analysis while breaking down charts and encouraging psychological analysis that balances skills with emotional intelligence (EMI). It's a pleasure to share ideas and work with a community of peers that share the same interest in sharing while learning. My learning curve has increased drastically.
Wallstreet Academy has provided a platform for learning. I'm more confident and will be able to share the knowledge I gain with my kids.
Thanks to Cue and the entire Wallstreet Academy team. Please send the market analysis to this email address.

I had some experience, but no real consistency. I didn’t know what confirmation truly meant, I didn’t understand structure, and I definitely didn’t have a process.

My name is Ciprian Schiopu, and I want to thank you first for everything you’ve shared through Wall Street Academy. You’ve built something that’s way more than a trading course — it’s a mindset shift, a structure for discipline, and a blueprint for real growth.
Before WSA, I was just reacting to the market. I had some experience, but no real consistency. I didn’t know what confirmation truly meant, I didn’t understand structure, and I definitely didn’t have a process. Since learning from you, my entire outlook changed. I now approach the market with clarity, patience, and purpose. I don’t chase – I wait. I don’t guess – I analyze.
But more than the strategy, what impacted me most was your mentality. You showed me that trading isn’t about getting rich quick — it’s about becoming the version of yourself that’s capable of handling wealth, with calm and precision. That lesson alone is worth more than gold.
WSA gave me a standard. It gave me a method. But most of all, it gave me belief — belief that I can do this the right way, like a pro. Thank you for leading by example.
With full respect,

Before joining, trading felt like a gamble. Confusing, overwhelming, and inconsistent.


But the structured education, clear breakdowns, and real-life application of technical analysis gave me a whole new level of clarity and confidence.


It taught me not just how to trade, but how to think like a trader, how to approach the charts with discipline, patience, and a strategic mindset.


Ever since, I see the markets through a lens of structure and probability, not emotion or impulse.


It’s been a game changer in my growth, both as a trader and as a person striving for financial independence.

Kameron Salgado,kamsalgado@kam-fx.info,"Hey Cue, I started learning trading from WSA when I was 17, I opened my first live account when I was 18 and of course blew the money I put in since demo is different from live. Over the years I have continued learning and studying WSA and have been greatly impacted. There are countless times that trading has helped me in life whether its mentally or financially.

Wall Street Academy has been the turning point in how I approach the markets. Not just technically but mentally. Before WSA, I was drowning in confusion, hopping from strategy to strategy on youtbe, hoping something would stick.
I'm a breakeven trader on the verge of leveling up not because I said so but because the wins are slowly getting bigger and the losses are heavy but less frequent.
I finally built a foundation that makes sense. WSA taught me structure, discipline, and precision. It’s not just lines on a chart for me it’s a calculated approach to probability. I no longer panic when entering a trade because I know what I’m looking for. I hunt for confluence that matches the BIAS.
The way WSA broke down the markets made me realize that success requires effort and dedication and thats what brought me to this point.

Yaquub Warsame,yaquubwarsame@gmail.com,"The Impact of Wall Street Academy on My Market Perspective
The course I took with Cue Banks at Wall Street Academy has transformed my
perception of the financial markets. In the past, I thought trading would be uncertain and risky,
mostly depending on feelings and guessing instead of using a plan. As I’ve continued with this
course, I have improved my structured knowledge about the workings of the markets. Through
Cue Banks’ classes, I’m able to grasp the key things I need to know about market structure,
analysis of trends, risk management, and the psychology of trading.
The reason this program stands out is because it highlights discipline and mindset. I have
discovered that the main thing is to wait for the right stages rather than chase fast gains. Banks
frequently explain why following a plan consistently, adhering to your strategy, and managing
risk are so important. Improvements in trading helped me, and those lessons learned can now be
used elsewhere to help me be patient, stay focused, and be in control of my emotions.
I am still working through the course, and I continue to learn something new in every
class. I am learning to keep my mind grounded when dealing with the markets instead of getting
too emotional about every change. Now, studying price action and chart patterns is much easier
and clearer for me, which I found hard to imagine when I began.
Wall Street Academy has taught me as well as given me confidence. Thanks to it, I have
seen my skills as a trader improve, and I believe in my own trading ideas. We’re not done yet,
but I have already noticed I approach trading and everyday life differently. It’s clear to me now
what you can accomplish when you have the right information, advice, and attitude.","The Impact of Wall Street Academy on My Market Perspective

We used buy limits and sell limits and execution orders. Risking only 3%. Doing 1:3’s ratios. After about a year of that I was seeking more. I stumbled upon your interview on trading nut. It was like you were looking at all the details my former mentor wasn’t. Don’t get me wrong he was wining. But not like you was. And I wanted in. So I bought the course and just as I suspect there was a lot I didn’t know. That extra information sent me on wining streak with GU. Of all the pairs. Anyways learning, Fibs, market structure, the webinars, psychology courses, all made a big difference. To be honest I got my trading account up to 7k but had to use it during this whole divorce process. This all really set me back and it ain’t got nothing to do with your course. You shit live bro!

So I bought the course and just as I suspect there was a lot I didn’t know. That extra information sent me on wining streak with GU. Of all the pairs. Anyways learning, Fibs, market structure, the webinars, psychology courses, all made a big difference. To be honest I got my trading account up to 7k but had to use it during this whole divorce process. This all really set me back and it ain’t got nothing to do with your course. You shit live bro! You deserve all the credit. Keep going I’m right behind you.

Thanks

Derrick Jones,djones1616@yahoo.com,"What’s up Cue , its Derrick Jones. I joined Wallstreet Academy in 2021 and its been one hell of a ride with trading so far. I got introduce to trading with IML around 2019-20 , bad experiences just like everyone else, but I saw a positive thing out of a negative situation. During this time I was in college looking for a path where I can make some money on my own. I wasn’t good at school work and knew I wasn’t getting no job on Wall Street trading, and then came across your instagram and seen that you was really good at trading. I went through a bunch other courses trying to be cheap and just felt like I was studying bad information. Then I finally bought your course and finally starting gaining some knowledge on trading. Trading started really becoming a passion throughout all the hours studying , I knew it was a passion because I never took anything serious really in school , but Wall Street Academy has me taking notes and trying to find more ways to get better at the craft. I am a Amazon Driver who is trying to get his time back and make this a career, and have it fund other passions of mines, but I can’t seem to find consistency. Entries are not consistent , I always stray away from what works whenever I take a loss ,then I start overthinking. Then when it come to exits I don’t know if I should try to aim for H4 Tp 1 or H1 Tp 1. A couple more mistakes I make always trying to look for a retest or I try to get in on a continuation move but It always seem I get hit with drawdown then I have to get out of the trade. So I really just want to get some guidance from you and see how you see the market on a day to day basis. Appreciate everything you done for this community & changing my life.","What’s up Cue , its Derrick Jones. I joined Wallstreet Academy in 2021 and its been one hell of a ride with trading so far.
