# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Connection Management Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the backend API endpoints for managing connections to external services, including creation, testing, and deletion.
# Details:
Implement RESTful API endpoints for connection management:
1. POST /api/connections - Create a new connection
2. GET /api/connections - List all connections
3. GET /api/connections/:id - Get connection details
4. PUT /api/connections/:id - Update connection
5. DELETE /api/connections/:id - Delete connection
6. POST /api/connections/:id/test - Test connection

Ensure credentials are properly encrypted before storage. Implement connection testing logic that verifies the provided credentials work with the external service. For WordPress, test by making a simple API call to verify authentication works.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests for all API endpoints. Test connection creation with valid and invalid credentials. Verify connection testing works correctly for WordPress. Test updating connection credentials. Ensure deleted connections are properly removed from the database.
