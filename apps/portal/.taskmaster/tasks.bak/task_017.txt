# Task ID: 17
# Title: Fix React Key Prop Errors in Puck Editor Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve the "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop" error in the Puck editor by implementing wrapper components that properly assign unique keys to each UI component.
# Details:
Implement a solution to fix React key prop warnings in the Puck editor by:

1. Create a new file `puck-wrappers.tsx` that will contain wrapper components for each Puck UI component:
   - Ensure each wrapper is properly typed using TypeScript
   - Implement a higher-order component pattern that adds unique keys to child components
   - Maintain all original props and functionality of the wrapped components
   - Use meaningful key generation that ensures uniqueness (e.g., combining component type with an index or unique identifier)

2. Update `GroupDashboardEditor.tsx`:
   - Import the new wrapper components
   - Replace direct usage of Puck components with their wrapped versions
   - Ensure all component props are properly passed through to the wrapped components
   - Verify that the editor functionality remains unchanged

3. Update `PuckRenderer.tsx`:
   - Import the new wrapper components
   - Replace direct usage of Puck components with their wrapped versions
   - Ensure proper rendering of all UI elements
   - Maintain any existing event handlers and functionality

4. Implementation example for the wrapper components:
```tsx
// puck-wrappers.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { ComponentProps } from 'react';

// Define types for the components you need to wrap
type CardComponentProps = ComponentProps<typeof Card>;

// Create wrapper components that add keys
export const CardWrapper: React.FC<CardComponentProps & { index?: number }> = ({ 
  index, 
  children,
  ...props 
}) => {
  return (
    <Card {...props} key={`card-${index || Math.random()}`}>
      {children}
    </Card>
  );
};

// Repeat for other components that need wrapping
```

# Test Strategy:
To verify the fix has been properly implemented:

1. Manual testing:
   - Open the Group Dashboard Editor in the development environment
   - Verify that no React key warnings appear in the browser console
   - Test adding, removing, and rearranging components in the Puck editor
   - Ensure all editor functionality works as expected after the changes

2. Component testing:
   - Write unit tests for the wrapper components to verify they correctly pass props
   - Test that keys are properly generated and unique
   - Verify that wrapped components render identically to their unwrapped versions

3. Integration testing:
   - Test the full Group Dashboard Editor with the new wrapper components
   - Verify that components can be added, configured, and removed without errors
   - Check that saved configurations load correctly with the wrapper components

4. Console verification:
   - Run the application with React's development mode enabled
   - Confirm that no key-related warnings appear in the console
   - Use React DevTools to inspect the component hierarchy and verify keys are present

5. Performance check:
   - Verify that the addition of wrapper components doesn't negatively impact editor performance
   - Test with a complex dashboard layout to ensure smooth operation
