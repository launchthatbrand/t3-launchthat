# Task ID: 12
# Title: Create Visual Scenario Builder UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the visual interface for creating and editing automation scenarios with drag-and-drop functionality.
# Details:
Develop a visual scenario builder with:
1. Drag-and-drop interface for adding nodes
2. Connection lines between nodes to show data flow
3. Node configuration panels
4. Validation of scenario configuration

The builder should:
- Allow users to drag nodes from a palette onto the canvas
- Enable connecting nodes by drawing lines between outputs and inputs
- Show configuration panels when nodes are selected
- Validate connections between nodes
- Provide real-time feedback about invalid configurations
- Support saving scenarios as drafts

Consider using a library like React Flow or similar for the drag-and-drop functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for UI components. Test drag-and-drop functionality. Test connection validation logic. Create integration tests for saving and loading scenarios. Perform usability testing to ensure the builder is intuitive.
