# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Data Mapping Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the frontend interface for mapping data fields between external systems and Portal.
# Details:
Develop a data mapping interface with:
1. Source and destination field selection
2. Type conversion options
3. Default value settings
4. Validation rule configuration

The interface should:
- Show available fields from the source system
- Show available fields in the destination system
- Allow users to create mappings between fields
- Provide options for type conversion and transformation
- Allow setting default values for unmapped fields
- Validate mappings against destination field requirements

Example UI layout:
- Two columns showing source and destination fields
- Drag-and-drop or dropdown selection for mapping
- Configuration panel for selected mapping
- Preview of mapped data with sample values

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for mapping components. Test field selection and mapping creation. Test validation of mappings. Create integration tests for saving and loading mappings. Perform usability testing to ensure the interface is intuitive.
