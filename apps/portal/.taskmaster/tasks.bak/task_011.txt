# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Connection Management UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the frontend interface for adding, editing, testing, and deleting connections to external services.
# Details:
Implement the connection management UI with:
1. Form for adding new connections with dynamic fields based on app type
2. Edit form for updating connection credentials
3. Test connection functionality with status feedback
4. Confirmation dialog for deleting connections

The UI should:
- Dynamically generate form fields based on the app's configuration template
- Validate form inputs before submission
- Show appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- Provide real-time feedback during connection testing
- Warn users about potential impacts when deleting connections used in scenarios

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for form components. Test form validation logic. Test connection testing UI feedback. Create integration tests for API interactions. Perform usability testing to ensure the form is intuitive and error messages are helpful.
