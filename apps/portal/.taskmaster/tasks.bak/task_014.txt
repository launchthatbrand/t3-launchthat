# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Execution Logs and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the system for logging scenario executions, errors, and providing monitoring capabilities.
# Details:
Implement an execution logging system with:
1. Detailed logs for each scenario execution
2. Node-level execution details
3. Error information with context
4. Performance metrics

The system should:
- Log the start and end of each scenario execution
- Log the execution of each node with input and output data
- Capture errors with stack traces and context
- Store performance metrics (execution time, processed items, etc.)
- Provide an API for retrieving and filtering logs

Database schema:
- ExecutionLogs: id, scenario_id, status, started_at, completed_at, error
- NodeExecutionLogs: id, execution_id, node_id, status, started_at, completed_at, input, output, error

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for logging functionality. Test error capturing and formatting. Create integration tests for log retrieval API. Test performance under high log volume. Verify logs contain sufficient information for debugging.
