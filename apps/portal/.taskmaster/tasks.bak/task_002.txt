# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Credential Encryption System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure system for storing and managing integration credentials with proper encryption/decryption capabilities.
# Details:
Implement a credential management service with the following features:
1. Use industry-standard encryption (AES-256) for storing credentials
2. Create methods for encrypting credentials before storage
3. Create methods for decrypting credentials when needed for API calls
4. Implement key rotation capabilities
5. Ensure credentials are never logged or exposed in plaintext

Code example:
```
class CredentialManager {
  encrypt(plaintext) {
    // Use encryption key from secure environment variable
    // Return encrypted string
  }
  
  decrypt(encrypted) {
    // Decrypt and return plaintext for use in API calls
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for encryption/decryption. Verify that the same plaintext always encrypts to different ciphertexts (due to IV/salt). Ensure decryption correctly recovers the original plaintext. Test key rotation functionality. Perform security audit of the implementation.
