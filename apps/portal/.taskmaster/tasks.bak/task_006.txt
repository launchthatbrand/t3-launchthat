# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Scenario Data Model and API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the data model and API endpoints for managing automation scenarios, including creation, updating, and deletion.
# Details:
Implement the scenario management system with:
1. Data models for scenarios and their nodes
2. API endpoints for CRUD operations
3. Validation logic for scenario configuration

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/scenarios - Create scenario
- GET /api/scenarios - List scenarios
- GET /api/scenarios/:id - Get scenario details
- PUT /api/scenarios/:id - Update scenario
- DELETE /api/scenarios/:id - Delete scenario

Scenario model should include:
- Name and description
- Status (active, inactive, draft)
- Created/updated timestamps
- Associated nodes and their connections

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for the scenario model. Test API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting scenarios. Verify validation logic rejects invalid scenario configurations. Test that deleting a scenario properly removes associated nodes.
