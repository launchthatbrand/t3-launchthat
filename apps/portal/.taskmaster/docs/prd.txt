# Taskmaster – Admin Task Management System PRD

## Overview
Taskmaster is an admin-facing task management system for internal use. It enables users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, assign due dates (including recurring rules), and visualize tasks on a calendar. The system should leverage existing campaign calendar components for consistency and efficiency.

---

## Goals
- Provide a robust CRUD interface for managing tasks.
- Allow tasks to have due dates and support recurring schedules.
- Display all tasks with dates on a calendar, reusing campaign calendar UI.
- Ensure a seamless, modern admin experience using existing design systems and component libraries.

---

## Features & Requirements

### 1. Task CRUD
- **Create**: Admins can create new tasks with the following fields:
  - Title (string, required)
  - Description (string, optional)
  - Due Date (date, optional)
  - Recurring (boolean, optional)
  - Recurrence Rule (string, optional, e.g., daily/weekly/monthly or RRULE)
  - Status (enum: pending, completed, cancelled; default: pending)
- **Read**: List all tasks in a table or list view, sortable by date/status.
- **Update**: Edit any field of an existing task.
- **Delete**: Remove a task (with confirmation).

### 2. Task Dates & Recurrence
- **Due Date**: Tasks can have a single due date (date picker).
- **Recurring Tasks**:
  - Toggle to mark a task as recurring.
  - Select recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, or custom RRULE).
  - Recurring tasks should be expanded into individual events on the calendar view.

### 3. Calendar Integration
- **Calendar View**:
  - Display all tasks with due dates on a calendar.
  - Use the same calendar component as the campaign calendar for UI/UX consistency.
  - Clicking a calendar event opens the task details/edit modal.
  - Recurring tasks are shown on all relevant dates.
- **Filtering**:
  - Option to filter calendar by status (pending/completed/cancelled).
  - Option to show/hide recurring tasks.

### 4. UI/UX
- Use Shadcn UI components for forms, modals, tables, etc.
- Use React Hook Form + zod for form validation.
- Use React Query (convex/react) for data fetching and mutations.
- Ensure accessibility and responsive design.
- Maintain visual consistency with the admin/campaign calendar.

### 5. Backend
- Use Convex for data storage and API.
- Define a `tasks` table with the following fields:
  - id (Convex id)
  - title
  - description
  - dueDate
  - isRecurring
  - recurrenceRule
  - status
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt
- Implement Convex queries and mutations for all CRUD operations.

---

## Non-Goals
- No user assignment or multi-user collaboration in this phase.
- No notifications or reminders.
- No external integrations.

---

## Success Criteria
- Admins can create, edit, and delete tasks with all required fields.
- Tasks with due dates appear on the calendar.
- Recurring tasks are correctly expanded and displayed on the calendar.
- The UI is consistent with the rest of the admin panel and campaign calendar.
- All forms are validated and accessible.

---

## Milestones
1. **Backend**
   - Convex schema and CRUD API for tasks.
2. **Frontend**
   - Task list/table UI with CRUD.
   - Task form modal/drawer.
   - Calendar view with campaign calendar integration.
   - Recurrence rule support and expansion logic.
3. **Polish**
   - Filtering, accessibility, and responsive design.
   - QA and bugfixes.
