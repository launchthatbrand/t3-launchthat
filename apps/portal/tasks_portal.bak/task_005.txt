# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Groups System - Invitations and Membership Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the group invitation system and membership management features, allowing users to join groups and administrators to manage members.
# Details:
Implement the following features for group invitations and membership management:
1. Invitation mechanism for inviting users to join groups
2. Request to join functionality for users wanting to join private groups
3. Approval/rejection workflow for group admins
4. Member management interface for group administrators

API endpoints to implement:
- `inviteToGroup(groupId, userIds, message)`
- `requestToJoinGroup(groupId, message)`
- `respondToGroupRequest(requestId, approved)`
- `respondToGroupInvitation(invitationId, accepted)`
- `getGroupInvitations(userId or groupId)`
- `getGroupJoinRequests(groupId)`

UI components to implement:
- InviteMembersForm
- JoinRequestForm
- InvitationsList
- JoinRequestsList
- MembershipManagementInterface

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all API endpoints
2. Test invitation flows for different group privacy settings
3. Verify approval/rejection workflows function correctly
4. Test notification integration for invitations and requests
5. Validate that permissions are correctly enforced for different user roles
6. Test edge cases like inviting users who have already requested to join
