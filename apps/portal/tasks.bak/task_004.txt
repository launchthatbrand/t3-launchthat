# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Convex schema for e-commerce related entities including Products and Transactions.
# Details:
Extend the schema in convex/schema.ts to include Products (id, name, description, price, etc.), and Transactions (id, userId, productId, amount, status, timestamp, etc.). Define relationships between Products and Courses. Include appropriate indexes for efficient querying.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the schema by running Convex validation. Test creating sample records for Products and Transactions. Verify relationships between Products and Courses work as expected.
