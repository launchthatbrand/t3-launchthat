# Title: Create Admin Layout with Navigation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the base layout for the admin interface with navigation using Shadcn UI components.
# Details:
Create an admin layout component under `/admin` using Shadcn UI Sidebar. Implement the navigation structure for all admin sections (Courses, Lessons, Topics, Quizzes, Products, Users, Orders, Settings). Set up the route group for admin pages under /admin. Ensure the layout is responsive and includes proper authentication checks using Clerk's hooks/middleware to prevent unauthorized access to the entire `/admin` section.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the admin layout renders correctly with all navigation items. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Ensure authentication checks using Clerk prevent unauthorized access to the admin section.
