# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement User Profile Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Create functionality for users to view and update their profile information using Clerk's components and Convex for app-specific data.
# Details:
Implement user profile management using Clerk's `<UserProfile />` component for standard profile information (email, password, MFA, connected accounts). For app-specific profile data that needs to be stored in Convex, create separate forms/pages that link to the user via their Clerk user ID. Ensure all profile-related pages are only accessible to authenticated users.

# Test Strategy:
Test that Clerk's `<UserProfile />` component renders correctly and allows users to update their standard profile information. For app-specific profile data, test that forms correctly save data to Convex and retrieve it based on the Clerk user ID. Verify validation works correctly for custom fields. Ensure changes are persisted to the database. Test that only authenticated users can access and modify their own profile information.
