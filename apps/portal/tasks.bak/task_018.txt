# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement User Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a dashboard for users to view their purchased courses and access course content.
# Details:
Develop a user dashboard showing purchased courses. Create a clean and intuitive interface for accessing course content. Implement Convex queries for fetching user-specific data, linking via Clerk user ID stored in Convex. Ensure the dashboard is only accessible to authenticated users, verified using Clerk's hooks (useAuth) or middleware.

# Test Strategy:
Test that the dashboard correctly displays purchased courses. Verify that course access links work correctly. Ensure unauthenticated users are redirected appropriately using Clerk authentication. Test that user-specific data is correctly fetched based on the Clerk user ID.
