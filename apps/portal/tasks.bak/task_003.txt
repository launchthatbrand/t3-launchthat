# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Convex schema for all core entities including Users, Courses, Lessons, Topics, and Quizzes.
# Details:
Define the schema in convex/schema.ts with appropriate tables and fields for Users (id, name, email, role, etc.), Courses (id, title, description, etc.), Lessons (id, courseId, title, description, order, etc.), Topics (id, lessonId, title, content, type, order, etc.), and Quizzes (id, topicId/lessonId, title, etc.). Include appropriate indexes and relationships between entities.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the schema by running Convex validation. Ensure all required fields are present and relationships are correctly defined. Test creating sample records for each entity.
