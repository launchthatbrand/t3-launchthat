# Title: Create User Frontend Layout
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the base layout for the user-facing frontend with navigation and authentication components using Clerk for authentication.
# Details:
Create a user frontend layout with header, footer, and navigation using Shadcn components. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS. Integrate Clerk authentication components (<SignInButton>, <SignUpButton>, <UserButton>) or create custom buttons that trigger Clerk modals. Set up the route structure for user-facing pages. Ensure the layout adapts based on authentication state using Clerk hooks (useAuth, useUser) to conditionally render UI elements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the user layout renders correctly with all components. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes. Ensure authentication state is correctly reflected in the UI using Clerk's authentication state. Test that Clerk components render properly and authentication flows work as expected.
