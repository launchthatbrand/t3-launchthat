# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement User Authentication with Convex
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up user authentication using Clerk.
# Details:
Configure Clerk provider in the Next.js application using environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY). Create login and signup routes/components using Clerk's Next.js components (<SignIn>, <SignUp>). Implement authentication state management using Clerk's hooks (useAuth, useUser). Set up protected routes using Clerk middleware or helpers. Ensure Convex user schema includes necessary fields to potentially link with Clerk user IDs if needed for roles/app-specific data.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows via Clerk components. Verify authentication state (useAuth, useUser) provides correct user data. Ensure protected routes redirect unauthenticated users appropriately. Verify authentication state persists across page refreshes.
