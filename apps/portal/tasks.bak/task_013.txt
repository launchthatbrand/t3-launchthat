# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement User Management in Admin
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the admin interface for viewing and managing users with Clerk integration.
# Details:
Develop a users listing page in the admin UI using Shadcn UI Table component. Implement Convex queries to fetch user data (including roles) stored in the Convex `users` table. This table should potentially store the Clerk User ID for proper linking between authentication and application data. Consider whether to display users directly from Clerk API (if available) or primarily manage app-specific user data (like roles) in Convex with links to Clerk auth. Add search and filtering functionality for the users list. Implement basic user management functions (e.g., changing roles in the Convex table).

# Test Strategy:
Test that users are correctly displayed in the admin interface with proper Clerk integration. Verify that user details show the correct information. Test search and filtering functionality. Ensure role changes are applied correctly in the Convex table and properly reflected in the UI. Verify the linking between Clerk User IDs and Convex user records works as expected.
