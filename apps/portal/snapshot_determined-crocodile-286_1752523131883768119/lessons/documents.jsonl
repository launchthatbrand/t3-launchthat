This means that neither the buyer nor the sellers are pushing the price far enough to make a clear trend.\n\nIf this were a battle between the buyers and sellers, then this would be a draw. This is also a type of consolidation.\n\nIn the chart above, we can see that neither the buyers nor the sellers could push the price in their direction. When this happens, we get lower highs and higher lows.\n\nAs these two slopes get closer to each other, it means that a breakout is getting near. We don’t know what direction the breakout will be, but we do know that the market will most likely break out. Eventually, one side of the market will give in.\n\nSo how can we take advantage of this? Simple. We place entry orders above the slope of the lower highs and below the slope of the higher lows. Since we already know that the price is going to break out, we can just hitch a ride in whatever direction the market moves.","title":"Symmetrical Triangles","wp_id":624.0}

The “tops” are peaks which are formed when the price hits a certain level that can’t be broken.\n\nAfter hitting this level, the price will bounce off it slightly, but then return to test this level again. If the price bounces off that level again, then you have a DOUBLE top!\n\nIn the chart you can see that two peaks or “tops” were formed after a strong move up. Notice how the second top was not able to break the high of the first top. This is a strong sign that a reversal is going to occur because it is telling us that the buying pressure is just about finished. With the double top, we would place our entry order below the neckline because we are anticipating a reversal of the uptrend.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-792\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DoubleTopDownTrendRight-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nWow! We must be psychic or something, because we always seem to be on point! Looking at the chart you can see that the price breaks the neckline and makes a nice move down. Remember that double tops are a trend reversal formation so you’ll want to look for these after there is a strong uptrend.\n\nYou’ll also notice that the drop is approximately the same height as the double top formation. Keep that in mind because that’ll be useful in setting profit targets.","title":"Double Top DownTrend","wp_id":612.0}

What did we learn so far about these Japanese candlestick chart patterns?\n\nA rising wedge formed after an uptrend usually leads to a reversal (downtrend), while a rising wedge formed during a downtrend typically results in a continuation (downtrend). Simply put, a rising wedge leads to a downtrend, which means that it’s a bearish chart pattern!\n\nJust like the rising wedge, the falling wedge can either be a reversal or a continuation signal. As a reversal signal, it is formed at a bottom of a downtrend, indicating that an uptrend would come next.\n\nAs a continuation signal, it is formed during an uptrend, implying that the upward price action would resume. Unlike the rising wedge, the falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern.\n\nIn this example, the falling wedge serves as a reversal signal. After a downtrend, the price made lower highs and lower lows. Notice how the falling trend line connecting the highs is steeper than the trend line connecting the lows.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-786\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BearishWedgeRight1-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nUpon breaking above the top of the wedge, the pair made a nice move upwards that’s approximately equal to the height of the formation. In this case, the price rally went a few more pips beyond that target!\n\nLet’s take a look at an example where the falling wedge serves as a continuation signal. Like we mentioned earlier, when the falling wedge forms during an uptrend, it usually signals that the trend will resume later on.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-785\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BearishWedgeLeft2-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nIn this case, the price consolidated for a bit after a strong rally. This could mean that buyers simply paused to catch their breath and probably recruited more people to join the bull camp.\n\nHmm, it looks like the pair is revving up for a strong move. Which way would it go?\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-784\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BearishWedgeRight2-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nSee how the price broke to the top side and went on to climb higher?\n\nIf we placed an entry order above that falling trend line connecting the pair’s highs, we wouldn’t have been able to jump in on a strong uptrend and caught some pips! A good upside target would be the height of the wedge formation.\n\nIf you want to go for more pips, you can lock in some profits at the target by closing down a portion of your position, then letting the rest of your position ride.","title":"Bearish Wedge","wp_id":618.0}

If we had a short order just below the support level, we would have made a nice profit on this trade.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-769\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/RectanglesRight1-1-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nHere’s a tip: Once the pair falls below the support, it tends to make a move that is above the size of the rectangle pattern, in the example above, the pair moved beyond the target so there would have been a nice chance to catch more pips!","title":"Bearish Rectangle","wp_id":632.0}

The Forex market is the most liquid market in the world. It exchanges approximately $4.3 Trillion per day opposed to less liquid markets such as the New York Stock Exchange that  exchanges approximately $20 Billion per day. People turn to trade the Forex markets for a variety of reasons, some which I have listed below:</p><ul><li>You can trade from anywhere in the world</li><li>Most liquid market in the world</li><li>Traders can profit whether a specific currency is increasing or decreasing in value</li><li>Forex does not require a high initial investment</li><li>Traders can begin with as little as $100 which makes Forex all the more popular</li><li>High liquidity allows large amounts of leverage</li><li>Some brokers allow leverage up to 1:1000</li></ul><p>The goal of Forex is to buy a currency that is anticipated to gain value or sell a currency that is anticipated to lose value against another currency.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLEARN MORE\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h3>What do people trade?</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>When trading Forex, it is inevitable that traders will run across currencies known as “The Majors”. This term refers to the most frequently traded currencies in the world, with a list normally including the Euro (EUR), US Dollar (USD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Great British Pound (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), and the Swiss Franc (CHF).</p><p>In the graph below, you will find a list of the Major currencies along with their associated country and ISO Symbol. The symbol is how you will know exactly which currency you are trading when referencing a Forex Bid/Ask quote. However, it is also important to review each currencies nickname. These names will often come up in research and will be handy when communicating with other Forex Traders.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLEARN MORE\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h3>What are the four major markets to trade?</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The four major markets to trade include the London Session (3am EST-12pm EST), the New York Session (8am EST to 5pm EST), the Sydney Session (5pm EST to 2am EST), and the Tokyo Session (7pm EST to 4am EST). During summer and winter months from 8am to 12 pm the London and New York session overlap.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>The London Session</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>It is this session that 99% of traders keep their eyes on as London controls essentially the entire European market movements. Roughly 30% of all market transactions take place in the London Session. The following is important to keep in mind when trading the London Session:</p><ul><li>Due to the London Session overlapping with two other major trading sessions, a large portion of Forex transactions are made during this time. This leads to a massive surge in liquidity which can also lead to lower transaction costs as there will be more volume per user at the broker level</li><li>The London Session is known to be specifically volatile for the EUR/USD (EU), as there is a plethora of European news that is released within a couple hours of the opening of this session</li><li>Most Major movements that occur during the London Session also carry over into the New York Session</li><li>The best times to trade the EU &amp; GBP/USD is during the overlap of the London &amp; New York Session Price action may slow down and trends start to change as European traders close their trades and take their profits</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>The New York Session</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>This session begins at 8am EST. This is the most traded session amongst all Forex traders, primarily due to influential market news that makes market moves occur during this session. The most commonly traded pair during this session is the USD/JPY or EUR/USD, as well as Gold sometimes.</p><p>The following is important to keep in mind when trading the New York Session:</p><ul><li>Major news is released in the beginning</li><li>Every major transaction in the world involves the USD, so whenever any major news comes out which affects the USD anything that is directly related to it will move drastically</li><li>The New York Session begins to majorly slow down after 1pm EST</li><li>There is almost little or no movement Friday afternoons as Asian and London traders are done for the weekend</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>The Tokyo Session</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>The Tokyo Session is often referred to as the Asian session because Tokyo is the financial capital of Asia. Japan is the third largest trading center in the world, and the Japanese Yen is the third most traded currency partaking in 16.5% of all forex transactions. Overall about 21% of all transactions take place during this session. The following is important to keep in mind when trading the Tokyo Session:</p><ul><li>The most commonly traded pair is the USD/JPY</li><li>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been known to inject massive amounts of government printed money into the markets should they feel their currency is getting too strong. This has caused the markets to move 2000 pips within 20 minutes in the past</li><li>Liquidity can often be very thin, therefore making this session boring because of the lack of activity</li><li>It is more likely to see movement in Asia Pacific pairs like the AUD/USD and NZD/USD opposed to pairs like the GBP/USD</li><li>Most action takes place early in this session due to major economic data that is released. The AUD/USD is known to make large movements during this time.</li></ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>The Sydney Session</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>This session is starts and ends the trading week Starting on Sunday at 5pm EST and ending the week at 5pm EST. This session focuses on the volatility of AUD pairs. (ex. AUDUSD, GBPAUD, AUDJPY. Normally this session has a very low volatility compared to the other sessions.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Overview</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>If you are looking for times of major volatility, then look for times when two sessions overlap. Also note, trading on Fridays and Sundays can be a costly venture. Sunday is when investors are looking for the news to create a market path. Paths can often go one way Sunday and completely reverse come Monday. Same case for Fridays. NEVER hold a trade through the weekend as you are exposed to gaps in the market come Sunday when markets open due to news announced when the market is closed throughout the weekend. The only exception is if you plan on swinging a trade for an extended period of time, and it is a part of your strategy.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLEARN MORE\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h3>Three Types of Analysis</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Traders often break down the analysis of the charts or Forex pairs into three different categories: Technical analysis, Fundamental analysis, or Traders sentiment.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Technical Analysis</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>This is reading the charts using a series of technical tools which normally involves tools that are developed using some sort of mathematical equation and using historical data to predict what will happen next.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Fundamental Analysis</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>This is a review of the economics and political forces that might come into play when forecasting the direction of a currency pair or tradeable instrument. Fundamental Analysis is examining the underlying drivers affecting our wellbeing such as economic health of a region in which that currency is most dominant in, interest rates, or even relationships between countries. The majority of Fundamental traders rely on news daily, weekly, or monthly to decide whether they will buy or sell an instrument.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Traders sentiment refers to how people can devise their own opinions over how the market is changing and where its heading to. They may do this using one of three types of charts which include Line Charts, Bar Charts, or Candlestick Charts with no real form of analysis</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"#\" role=\"button\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLEARN MORE\n\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t<h3>Technical Analysis - Using Live Data!</h3>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Trend</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>This is commonly used because it very clearly shows prevailing trend. The downside is these indicators typically have a delay in predicting the movements of price action which is why they have the name “lagging indicators”. These indicators work poorly in flat or ranging trends. These indicators smooth out price data but should never solely be relied upon. Examples: Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, and Ichimoku Kinko Hyo</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Support & Resistance</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>Support levels are levels where price has had a hard time pushing down through. Resistance levels are levels where price has had a hard time pushing up through. Plot using horizontal lines and place where price has had a hard time pushing through. Support &amp; Resistance levels are dynamic meaning price may push past the levels only to reverse. This is a new resistance or support level now but should be coupled with old Support &amp; Resistance levels to for a Support &amp; Resistance Area.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Oscillators\n</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>These are used when trend is flat or ranging. Traders can use oscillators to determine whether a currency pair has entered an oversold or overbought area. Overbought and oversold simply refers to the loss of steam or pressure in any one direction over a specific period of days. The name oscillator is derived from the Latin work oscillo which means “I swing”. Examples: Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastics, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and the Momentum Indicator.</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Volume Based Indicators\n</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>These indicators measure the worth of a specific instrument or currency pair by determining the overall volume of transactions in any one direction by an active involvement of participants. High volume spikes can generally either change the direction of the markets or help determine a new trend. If the move lacks volume, then there will be no conviction and prices may retrace to their original starting position. These are referred to as “leading indicators” because they tend to be ahead of price action. Examples: Volumes, Money Flow Index, and On Balance Volume</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Strength Based Indicators</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>These indicators help reduce downside risk and increase your profit potentials by indicating a strong, clear movement.. Strength indicators assist a trader in displaying the intensity of market opinion on a certain price by examining the market positions taken by various market participants. Example: ADX Indicator</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Volatility Based Indicators\n</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>These indicators monitor fluctuations in currency pairs or instruments by comparing current price to historical values. Changes in volatility tends to anticipate changes in prices or can forecast a major price spike. The overall purpose of volatility based indicators is used to detect an imbalance in the markets and help traders generate a buy or sell signal. The downside is they take no account for other data in respect to price actionExample: Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR).</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Momentum Based Indicators</h3>\t\t\n\t\t<p>These are used to determine the strength or weakness of a trend as it progresses overtime. Momentum is highest when trends start and lowest when trends change or end. Momentum indicators derives data that compares current price in relation to past price. When current prices are higher than in the past the momentum indicators will show a positive signal and vice versa. When price and momentum diverge it suggests weakness. If price extremes occur with weak momentum it suggests the end of the movement in that direction. If momentum is trending strongly and prices are flat, it signals a potential change in direction. Examples: Stochastics, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Relative Strength Index (RSI)</p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<h3>Technical Analysis - Using Live Data!</h3>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">How to Review a Currency Pair?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The reason currency is quoted in pairs is because you are simultaneously buying one currency and selling the other.</p><p>Example:</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Going Long/Short</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Long means you are buying the base currency and selling the quoted currency and going short means you are selling the base currency and buying the quoted currency.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Bid/Ask Prices?</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Majority of the time the bid is lower than the asking price.</p><p>The bid price is the best available price the broker is willing to buy the base currency for in exchange for the quoted currency to sell to market.</p><p>The ask price is the best price at which your broker will sell the base currency for in exchange for the quoted currency.

The tick on the left indicates where price opened, tick on the right indicates where price closed, and the vertical bar represents extreme highs and lows of price movement.<br /><br />Candlestick Charts- these are the most commonly used charts. They are the same as Bar Charts except they have a real body to them.</p>","courseId":"jx797xece6xk2as0sjk8rd1n817eqg9t","title":"Introduction To Forex","wp_id":546.0}

In descending triangle chart patterns, there is a string of lower highs which form the upper line. The lower line is a support level in which the price cannot seem to break.\n\nIn the chart above, you can see that the price is gradually making lower highs which tells us that the sellers are starting to gain some ground against the buyers.\nNow most of the time, and we do say MOST, the price will eventually break the support line and continue to fall.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the support line will be too strong, and the price will bounce off of it and make a strong move up.The good news is that we don’t care where the price goes. We just know that it’s about to go somewhere. In this case, we would place entry orders above the upper line (the lower highs), and below the support line.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-777\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/TrianglesCenter1-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nIn this case, the price ended up breaking above the top of the triangle pattern. After the upside breakout, it proceeded to surge higher, by around the same vertical distance as the height of the triangle.\n\nPlacing an entry order above the top of the triangle and going for a target as high as the height of the formation wouldn’t yield nice profits.\n\nNow the question is, “which direction will it go? Will the buyers be able to break that level or will the resistance be too strong?” Many charting books will tell you that in most cases, the buyers will win this battle and the price will break past the resistance. However, it has been our experience that this is not always the case. Sometimes the resistance level is too strong, and there is simply not enough buying power to push it through.\n\nMost of the time, the price will in fact go up. The point we are trying to make is that you should not be obsessed with which direction the price goes, but you should be ready for movement in EITHER direction. In this case, we would set an entry order above the resistance line, and below the slope of the higher lows.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-776\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/TrianglesRight1-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nIn this scenario, the buyers lost the battle and the price proceeded to dive! You can see that the drop was approximately the same distance as the height of the triangle formation.\n\nIf we set our short order below the bottom of the triangle, we could have caught some pips off that dive.","title":"Descending Triangles","wp_id":626.0}

After a big upward or downward move, buyers or sellers usually pause to catch their breath before taking the pair further in the same direction. Because of this, the price usually consolidates and forms a tiny symmetrical triangle, which is called a pennant.\n\nWhile the price is still consolidating, more buyers or sellers usually decide to jump in on the strong move, forcing the price to bust out of the pennant formation. A bearish pennant is formed during a steep, almost vertical, downtrend. After that sharp drop in price, some sellers close their positions while other sellers decide to join the trend, making the price consolidate for a bit.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-782\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BearishPennantsRight-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nAs soon as enough sellers jump in, the price breaks below the bottom of the pennant and continues to move down.\n\nAs you can see, the drop resumed after the price made a breakout to the bottom. To trade this chart patter, we’d put a short order at the bottom of the pennant with a stop loss above the pennant. That way, we’d be out of the trade right away in case the breakdown was a fake out.","title":"Bearish Pennants","wp_id":620.0}

A “neckline” is drawn by connecting the lowest points of the two troughs. The slope of this line can either be up or down. Typically, when the slope is down, it produces a more reliable signal.\n\nIn this example, we can easily see the head and shoulders pattern.\n\nThe head is the second peak and is the highest point in the pattern. The two shoulders also form peaks, but do not exceed the height of the head.\nWith this formation, we put an entry order below the neckline. We can also calculate a target by measuring the high point of the head to the neckline. This distance is approximately how far the price will move after it breaks the neckline.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-794\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HeadAndshouldersMarkPatterns2Right-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nYou can see that once the price goes below the neckline, it makes a move that is at least the size of the distance between the head and the neckline.\n\nWe know you’re thinking to yourself, “the price kept moving even after it reached the target”.","title":"Head and Shoulders Downtrend","wp_id":609.0}

This means that the sharp climb in price would resume after that brief period of consolidation, when bulls gather enough energy to take the price higher again.\n\nIn this example, the price made a sharp vertical climb before taking a breather.

To play this, we’d place our long order above the pennant and our stop loss below the bottom of the pennant to avoid fake outs.\n\nLike we discussed earlier, the size of the breakout move is around the height of the mast (or the size of the earlier move).

These formations occur after extended downtrends when two valleys or “bottoms” have been formed.\n\nYou can see from the chart above that after the previous downtrend, the price formed two valleys because it wasn’t able to go below a certain level.\n\nNotice how the second bottom wasn’t able to significantly break the first bottom. This is a sign that the selling pressure is about finished, and that a reversal is about to occur.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-788\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DoubleBottomUptrendRight-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nWould you look at that! The price broke the neckline and made a nice move upwards.\n\nSee how the price jumped by almost the same height as that of the double bottom formation? Remember, just like double tops, double bottoms are also trend reversal formations. You’ll want to look for these after a strong downtrend.","title":"Double Bottom UpTrend","wp_id":616.0}

Here, the slope of the support line is steeper than that of the resistance. This indicates that higher lows are being formed faster than higher highs. This leads to a wedge-like formation, which is exactly where the chart pattern gets it’s name from!\n\nWith prices consolidating, we know that a big splash is coming, so we can expect a breakout to either the top or bottom. If the rising wedge forms after an uptrend, it’s usually a bearish reversal pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if it forms during a downtrend, it could signal a continuation of the downward move.\n\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you spot this forex trading chart pattern, you’re ready with your entry orders! In this first example, a rising wedge formed at the end of an uptrend. Notice how price action is forming new highs, but at a much slower pace than when price makes higher lows.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-774\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BullishWedgeRight1-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nSee how price broken down to the downside? That means there are more forex traders desperate to be short than be long! They pushed the price down to break the trendline, indicating that a downtrend may be in the cards.\n\nJust like in the other chart patterns we discussed earlier, the price movement after the breakout is approximately the same magnitude as the height of the formation. Now let’s take a look at another example of a rising wedge formation. Only this time it acts as a bearish continuation signal.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-773\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BullishWedgeLeft2-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nAs you can see, the price came from a downtrend before consolidating and sketching higher highs and even higher lows.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-772\" style=\"font-size: 1rem;\" src=\"https://app.wsatraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BullishWedgeRight2-300x217.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" />\n\nIn this case, the price broke to the downside and the downtrend continued. That’s why it’s called a continuation signal, yo!","title":"Rising Wedge","wp_id":628.0}
