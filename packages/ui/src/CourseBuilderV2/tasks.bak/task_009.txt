# Title: Implement lesson drag-and-drop
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering lessons
# Details:
Implement lesson drag-and-drop that:
- Makes lessons draggable using @dnd-kit
- Adds drag handles to lessons
- Provides visual feedback during dragging (drag overlay)
- Shows drop indicators between lessons
- Handles optimistic UI updates during drag
- Calls onReorderItems when a lesson is dropped in a new position
- Prevents invalid drop operations

# Test Strategy:
Test dragging lessons up and down in the list. Verify visual feedback appears correctly. Confirm onReorderItems is called with correct parameters when a lesson is reordered.
