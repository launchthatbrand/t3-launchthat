# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Sidebar Accordion UI with Draggable Items
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the CourseBuilderV2 sidebar to use Shadcn Accordion components that display Lessons, Topics, and Quizzes in collapsible sections with drag-and-drop functionality.
# Details:
This task involves replacing the current sidebar implementation with Shadcn Accordion components to create a more organized and interactive UI. The implementation should:

1. Create three separate accordion sections for Lessons, Topics, and Quizzes
2. Fetch available items from the API for each section
3. Display items with appropriate icons and metadata
4. Implement collapsible behavior for each section
5. Make all items draggable using a library like react-dnd or @dnd-kit/core
6. Ensure proper styling that matches the application's design system
7. Add hover states and visual feedback for draggable items
8. Implement proper loading states while fetching data
9. Handle empty states appropriately when no items are available
10. Ensure the sidebar is responsive and maintains usability on smaller screens

The accordion should maintain its state (which sections are expanded/collapsed) during the user's session. When items are dragged, they should have a visual indicator showing they're being dragged and where they can be dropped.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the UI functionality and the drag-and-drop behavior:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test that accordion sections render correctly with the expected items
   - Verify that sections expand and collapse as expected
   - Test loading and empty states

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify that data is correctly fetched and displayed
   - Test that dragging an item works and generates the correct events

3. Manual testing:
   - Verify accordion sections expand/collapse smoothly
   - Confirm all items are displayed with correct styling and icons
   - Test dragging items from each section to valid drop targets
   - Verify visual feedback during drag operations
   - Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior
   - Check keyboard accessibility for accordion functionality
   - Verify that screen readers can interpret the accordion structure

4. Browser compatibility:
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure consistent behavior
