/**
 * WordPress Puck Plugin
 *
 * Placeholder for WordPress-specific Puck integrations.
 *
 * NOTE: Adding components via plugins appears to have issues in this version of Puck.
 * The recommended approach is to add components directly to the config.components object
 * in puck.config.jsx instead.
 *
 * This plugin is currently a placeholder for future WordPress-specific features like:
 * - Custom field types for WordPress data
 * - Integration with WordPress media library
 * - Custom save handlers
 * - WordPress-specific UI customizations
