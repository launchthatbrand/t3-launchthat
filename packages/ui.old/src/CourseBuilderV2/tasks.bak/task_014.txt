# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement error handling and loading states
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add comprehensive error handling and loading states throughout the component
# Details:
Implement error handling and loading states that:
- Catches and displays errors from callback functions
- Shows appropriate loading indicators during async operations
- Provides fallback UI for error states
- Handles edge cases (e.g., network failures during drag operations)
- Implements retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Maintains UI consistency during async operations

# Test Strategy:
Test error scenarios by simulating failed promises. Verify loading indicators appear during async operations. Test recovery from error states.
