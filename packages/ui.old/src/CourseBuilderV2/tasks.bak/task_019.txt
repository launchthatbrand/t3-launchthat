# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Quiz Drop Zones on Lessons/Topics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance Lesson and Topic components to function as drop zones for Quiz elements dragged from the sidebar or other containers, in addition to the existing Final Quiz Area.
# Details:
This task involves modifying the Lesson and Topic components to accept Quiz elements via drag-and-drop functionality. Implementation should include:

1. Add drop zone capabilities to both Lesson and Topic component containers
2. Configure these components to recognize and accept only Quiz-type elements
3. Implement visual indicators that appear when a Quiz is being dragged over a valid drop zone (e.g., highlighted borders, background color change)
4. Create handlers for the onDrop event that will:
   - Validate the dragged item is a Quiz component
   - Add the Quiz to the Lesson/Topic's content structure
   - Update the UI to display the Quiz within the Lesson/Topic
   - Maintain proper state management for the Quiz's new location
5. Ensure proper positioning of the Quiz within the Lesson/Topic content flow
6. Add the ability to reposition Quizzes within the Lesson/Topic container
7. Implement proper data model updates when Quizzes are added to Lessons/Topics
8. Ensure the Quiz maintains all its properties and configurations when moved
9. Add appropriate animations for the drop action to improve user experience
10. Ensure accessibility standards are maintained for drag and drop operations

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the technical functionality and user experience of the Quiz drop zones:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Verify drop zone handlers correctly identify Quiz components vs other draggable elements
   - Test that the data model is properly updated when Quizzes are dropped
   - Ensure event handlers are properly registered and unregistered to prevent memory leaks

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test dragging Quizzes from the sidebar to Lessons/Topics
   - Test dragging Quizzes between different Lessons/Topics
   - Test dragging Quizzes from Lessons/Topics to the Final Quiz Area
   - Verify state management correctly tracks Quiz locations across the application

3. UI/UX Tests:
   - Verify visual indicators appear correctly when dragging over valid drop zones
   - Test that drop animations render properly
   - Ensure the Quiz is positioned correctly in the UI after being dropped

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test behavior when attempting to add multiple Quizzes to the same location
   - Verify proper handling when dragging a Quiz over invalid drop zones
   - Test undo/redo functionality for drag and drop operations
   - Test behavior when dragging Quizzes in various states (e.g., empty, partially configured)

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify keyboard navigation alternatives for drag and drop operations
   - Test screen reader compatibility for the drag and drop process
