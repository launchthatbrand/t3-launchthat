# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Admin Quiz Creation Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an admin page at /admin/courses/quizzes/new with a form that allows administrators to create new quizzes that are not yet attached to any course.
# Details:
Develop a new admin page accessible at the route /admin/courses/quizzes/new that includes a form for creating unattached quizzes. The form should include the following fields:

1. Quiz title (required text field)
2. Quiz description (text area)
3. Time limit in minutes (number input)
4. Passing score percentage (number input, 0-100)
5. Instructions for students (rich text editor)
6. Randomize questions option (checkbox)
7. Show feedback option (checkbox with options for 'immediate', 'after submission', or 'after quiz closes')
8. Submit button

The page should:
- Include proper validation for all fields
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- Successfully save the quiz to the database when submitted
- Redirect to the quiz management page after successful creation
- Include a cancel button that returns to the quiz listing page without saving

The created quiz should be stored in the database with a status of 'draft' and not be associated with any course initially. This will allow administrators to create quiz content before assigning it to specific courses.

Ensure the page follows the existing admin UI design patterns and is responsive for different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the UI functionality and the backend operations:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Validate form field validation logic
   - Test the quiz creation service/controller methods
   - Verify proper state management for the form

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete form submission flow
   - Verify the quiz is correctly saved to the database
   - Confirm proper handling of validation errors

3. UI/Acceptance Tests:
   - Verify the form renders correctly with all required fields
   - Test form submission with valid data
   - Test form submission with invalid data and verify error messages
   - Verify cancel functionality works correctly
   - Test accessibility compliance using automated tools

4. Specific Test Cases:
   - Create a quiz with minimum required fields
   - Create a quiz with all fields populated
   - Attempt to submit with missing required fields
   - Verify the created quiz appears in the quiz management interface
   - Confirm the quiz is created with 'draft' status
   - Verify the quiz is not attached to any course

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
