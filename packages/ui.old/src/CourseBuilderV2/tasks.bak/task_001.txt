# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up component file structure and TypeScript interfaces
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial file structure for CourseBuilderV2 and define TypeScript interfaces for props and data models
# Details:
Create the following files:
- index.tsx (main component)
- types.ts (type definitions)
- utils.ts (helper functions)

Define interfaces for:
- Component props (CourseBuilderProps)
- Data models (Lesson, Topic, Quiz)
- Callback function signatures
- DnD-related types

Ensure the interfaces are comprehensive and properly typed with TypeScript.

# Test Strategy:
Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors. Review interfaces for completeness against PRD requirements.
