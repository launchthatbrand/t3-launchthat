# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Admin Page for Creating New Unattached Topics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new admin page at /admin/courses/topics/new with a form that allows administrators to add new topics that are not yet attached to any course.
# Details:
Implement a new admin page accessible at the route /admin/courses/topics/new. The page should include:

1. A form with the following fields:
   - Topic title (required, text field)
   - Topic description (optional, text area)
   - Topic order/priority (optional, number field)
   - Topic status (dropdown: active, inactive, draft)
   - Any relevant metadata fields

2. Form validation:
   - Client-side validation for required fields
   - Server-side validation to prevent duplicates
   - Error messages displayed next to relevant fields

3. Submit button that:
   - Sends a POST request to the appropriate API endpoint
   - Shows loading state during submission
   - Handles success/error responses appropriately

4. After successful submission:
   - Display a success message
   - Either clear the form for another entry or redirect to a topic list page

5. Navigation:
   - Include breadcrumbs for navigation hierarchy
   - Add a cancel button that returns to the topics list

6. Backend requirements:
   - Create necessary API endpoint to handle the form submission
   - Implement data validation and sanitization
   - Store the new topic in the database with 'unattached' status

Ensure the page follows the existing admin UI design patterns and is responsive for different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test form validation logic for required fields
   - Test API endpoint with valid and invalid data
   - Test database operations for creating new topics

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify the form submission process end-to-end
   - Test that validation errors are properly displayed
   - Confirm successful submissions create database entries

3. UI/UX Testing:
   - Verify form layout matches design specifications
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure error states are clearly visible
   - Verify success messages are displayed appropriately

4. Functional Testing:
   - Submit a new topic and verify it appears in the topics list
   - Verify the topic is marked as 'unattached'
   - Test the cancel button returns to the expected page
   - Verify breadcrumb navigation works correctly
   - Test with various input combinations (all fields, minimal fields)

5. Edge Cases:
   - Test with very long text inputs
   - Test with special characters in fields
   - Test concurrent submissions
   - Test with network interruptions during submission
