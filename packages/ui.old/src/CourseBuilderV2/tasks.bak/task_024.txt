# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Admin Page for Creating New Unattached Topics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new admin page at /admin/courses/topics/new that provides a form interface for administrators to add new topics that are not yet attached to any courses.
# Details:
Implement a new admin page with the following specifications:

1. Create a route at `/admin/courses/topics/new` that is only accessible to users with admin privileges
2. Design a form with the following fields:
   - Topic title (required, text field)
   - Topic description (optional, text area)
   - Topic order/priority (optional, number field)
   - Topic status (dropdown: active/inactive)
   - Any relevant metadata fields for topics

3. Implement form validation:
   - Ensure required fields are completed
   - Validate that topic titles are unique in the system
   - Provide clear error messages for validation failures

4. On successful submission:
   - Create a new topic record in the database
   - Set the topic's status to 'unattached' or equivalent
   - Redirect to the topics list page with a success message

5. Include a cancel button that returns to the topics list without creating a record

6. Ensure the page follows the existing admin UI design patterns and styling

7. Add appropriate breadcrumb navigation (Admin > Courses > Topics > New)

8. Implement proper CSRF protection for the form submission

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and security of the new admin page:

1. **Access Control Tests**:
   - Verify that non-admin users cannot access the page
   - Verify that admin users can access the page

2. **Form Validation Tests**:
   - Test submission with empty required fields
   - Test submission with duplicate topic titles
   - Test submission with valid data

3. **Functionality Tests**:
   - Verify a new topic is correctly created in the database
   - Verify the topic is marked as unattached
   - Verify redirect to topics list after successful creation
   - Verify cancel button returns to topics list without creating a record

4. **UI Tests**:
   - Verify form layout matches admin design patterns
   - Verify error messages display correctly
   - Verify breadcrumb navigation is correct

5. **Security Tests**:
   - Verify CSRF protection is working
   - Test for XSS vulnerabilities with special characters in input fields

6. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify newly created topics appear in the topics list
   - Verify newly created topics can be attached to courses later
