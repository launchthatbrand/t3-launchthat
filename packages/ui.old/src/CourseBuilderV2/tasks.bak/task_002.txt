# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement basic component skeleton with empty state
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the basic structure of the CourseBuilderV2 component with empty state rendering
# Details:
Create the main component structure that:
- Accepts all required props as defined in the PRD
- Renders the empty state when initialLessons is empty or null
- Includes the message "Course has no content yet. Add a new Lesson or add an existing one from the sidebar."
- Styles the empty state according to the reference image using Tailwind CSS
- Includes a '+ New Lesson' button that calls onAddLesson when clicked

# Test Strategy:
Render the component with empty initialLessons and verify the empty state appears correctly. Test that clicking the '+ New Lesson' button calls the onAddLesson callback.
