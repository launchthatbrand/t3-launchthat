# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Topic Drop Zones on Lesson Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable Lesson components to function as drop zones that accept Topic components dragged from the sidebar or other lessons.
# Details:
Modify the Lesson component to act as a drop target for Topic components. Implementation should include:

1. Add drop zone functionality to the Lesson component using React DnD or a similar drag-and-drop library
2. Create visual indicators that appear when a Topic is being dragged over a Lesson (e.g., highlighted border or background)
3. Implement logic to handle the drop event, which should:
   - Accept only Topic components as valid drag items
   - Update the data model to associate the dropped Topic with the target Lesson
   - Handle both new Topics from the sidebar and existing Topics from other Lessons
   - Maintain the original Topic data while updating its parent reference
4. Add animation for the Topic being added to the Lesson
5. Ensure proper state updates so the UI reflects the new Topic arrangement immediately
6. Implement proper error handling for invalid drops
7. Optimize performance for smooth dragging experience even with multiple Topics and Lessons
8. Ensure accessibility compliance with ARIA attributes for drag and drop operations

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and user experience aspects:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test that Lesson components properly register as drop targets
   - Verify drop handlers correctly process Topic objects
   - Test that state updates correctly after successful drops

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify Topics can be dragged from sidebar to Lessons
   - Verify Topics can be moved between different Lessons
   - Test that the data model is correctly updated after drops

3. UI/UX tests:
   - Verify visual indicators appear when dragging over valid drop zones
   - Test that invalid drop attempts are properly rejected with feedback
   - Verify animations work correctly

4. Accessibility tests:
   - Test keyboard navigation for drag and drop operations
   - Verify screen readers announce drag operations appropriately

5. Edge cases:
   - Test behavior when dropping multiple Topics rapidly
   - Verify performance with many Topics and Lessons
   - Test undo/redo functionality after drop operations
