# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement basic lesson rendering
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the UI for rendering lessons without drag-and-drop functionality
# Details:
Implement lesson rendering that:
- Maps through initialLessons to display each lesson
- Shows lesson titles
- Includes a placeholder for the drag handle (to be implemented later)
- Adds a '+ New Lesson' button at the bottom of the list
- Styles lessons according to the design using Tailwind CSS
- Includes collapse/expand functionality for lessons
- Adds a '+ New Topic' button within each lesson

# Test Strategy:
Render the component with sample lesson data and verify lessons display correctly. Test collapse/expand functionality and verify the '+ New Topic' button appears within each lesson.
