# Website Traffic Analysis — `lama-international.com`

**Website**: `https://lama-international.com/`  
**Inception (per request)**: **November 2024**  
**Scope**: **Domain incl. subdomains** (per provided dataset)  
**Data source**: Ahrefs “Organic traffic” snapshot (user-provided excerpt)

---

## What this report can and cannot claim

- **What we have**: Ahrefs _estimated_ **organic search traffic** and keyword/page breakdown at a point in time.
- **What we do NOT have (yet)**: actual analytics totals (GA4, Plausible, Cloudflare, etc.) for **all visits** (direct, referral, paid, social, email, etc.).

Because the request asks for “**total website visits since inception**”, this report provides:

- **Organic-only estimates** (based on Ahrefs snapshot), and
- A clearly-labeled **projection** for “since Nov 2024” that requires assumptions.

If you want “total visits” (all channels), share an export from GA4 (monthly sessions) or another analytics source and I’ll replace the estimates with actuals.

## Monthly averages (site + page)

### Site-level monthly average (organic)

Ahrefs “Organic traffic” is commonly interpreted as a **monthly organic visit estimate**.

- **Estimated organic visits/month (site total)**: **48**

### Page-level monthly average (organic)

Using the “Top pages” split as the monthly distribution:

- **Homepage**: ~**43 organic visits/month**
- **About Us**: ~**2 organic visits/month**
- **Gallery**: ~**1 organic visit/month**
- **Motorcycle Safety Awareness**: ~**1 organic visit/month**
- **Damas de L.A.M.A.**: ~**1 organic visit/month**

## Total visits since inception (Nov 2024) — organic-only estimate

### Time window used for calculations

Assuming inception = **2024-11-01** and “since inception” through **2026-01-13** (today), that’s:

- **15 months** (Nov–Dec 2024 = 2, full year 2025 = 12, Jan 2026 = 1)

> If you want this computed through **end of last full month** (Dec 2025) instead, that would be **14 months**.

### Organic-only cumulative estimate (projection)

This assumes organic traffic was roughly stable at ~48/month for the whole period (likely untrue; use as a directional estimate only).

- **Estimated organic visits since Nov 2024**: \(48 \times 15 = 720\)

### Organic-only cumulative estimate by top page (projection)

Applying the same “stable monthly” assumption and the Ahrefs top page shares:

- **Homepage**: \(43 \times 15 = 645\)
- **About Us**: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
- **Gallery**: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- **Motorcycle Safety Awareness**: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- **Damas de L.A.M.A.**: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)

---

## Notes & opportunities (based on the snapshot)

- **Brand/query concentration**: Top keywords are tightly aligned with the organization name; this is good for intent, but suggests limited non-brand discovery.
- **Homepage dominance**: ~90% of organic traffic is landing on `/`, meaning internal pages likely need stronger keyword targeting + internal linking to capture non-brand queries.
- **Country concentration**: 100% US in this dataset; if the org is international, consider localized pages or outreach for other regions.

## What I need from you to finish “total visits since inception” accurately

Pick one:

1. **GA4**: monthly sessions since Nov 2024 (export CSV), ideally broken down by landing page.
2. **Plausible / Cloudflare / other**: monthly visits since Nov 2024.

Then I’ll update this report to include:

- **Total visits (all channels)** since Nov 2024
- **Monthly average visits** per site and per page (actuals)
