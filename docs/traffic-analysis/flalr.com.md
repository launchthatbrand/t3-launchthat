# Website Traffic Analysis — `flalr.com` / `flalr.org`

**Website**: _(confirm canonical domain: `https://flalr.com/` or `https://flalr.org/`)_  
**Inception (per request)**: **November 2024**  
**Data sources**:
- GA4 export: `docs/flalr.com - page views - 10-28-2024 to 1-12-2026.csv` (Page path and screen class)
- Ahrefs organic snapshot: **not provided yet** (can be added once shared)

---

## What this report can and cannot claim

- The provided GA4 export is **page views** (not sessions/visits). Page views are useful for volume, but not identical to “visits”.
- The GA4 export window begins **2024-10-28**, slightly before the requested inception month (Nov 2024). This report includes both:
  - exact totals for the available window, and
  - a clearly-labeled prorated estimate “since Nov 2024”.

If you export GA4 **Sessions** (visits) as CSV, we can replace page-view-based “total visits” with actual visits.

## GA4 page views (actuals) — totals and monthly averages

### GA4 report window (page views CSV)

From the file metadata:
- **Start**: 2024-10-28
- **End**: 2026-01-12

Computed from that window:
- **Total days covered**: **442**
- **Month-equivalent (days ÷ 30.4375)**: **14.52 months**

### Site-wide totals (GA4 page views)

- **Total page views in GA4 window**: **10,085**
- **Average page views / month (over this window)**: **694.48**

### Top pages by GA4 page views (total + monthly average)

| Page path | Views | Share | Avg views / month |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `/` | 4,617 | 45.78% | 317.94 |
| `/events/` | 645 | 6.40% | 44.42 |
| `/resources/` | 578 | 5.73% | 39.80 |
| `/about-us/` | 328 | 3.25% | 22.59 |
| `/membership/chapter-map/` | 287 | 2.85% | 19.76 |
| `/membership/` | 230 | 2.28% | 15.84 |
| `/capture-the-plaque/` | 215 | 2.13% | 14.81 |
| `/photo-gallery/` | 204 | 2.02% | 14.05 |
| `/support-alr/` | 174 | 1.73% | 11.98 |
| `/membership/starting-a-chapter/` | 142 | 1.41% | 9.78 |

## Monthly averages per site/page (requested)

### Site-level monthly average

- **GA4 page views / month (2024-10-28 → 2026-01-12)**: **694.48**

### Page-level monthly average (GA4)

For any page path in the GA4 export:

\[
\text{avg page views per month} = \frac{\text{total page views in window}}{14.52}
\]

Examples: see the “Top pages” table above.

## Total visits since inception (Nov 2024) — best available answers

### 1) “Total” based on GA4 page views (actuals for available window)

- **Total GA4 page views (2024-10-28 → 2026-01-12)**: **10,085**

### 2) Estimated page views since Nov 1, 2024 (projection)

Because the GA4 window starts 4 days before Nov 1, 2024, we estimate the “since inception” number by prorating from the full-window average daily page views:

- Average per day in GA4 window: \(10085 / 442 \approx 22.82\)
- Days from **2024-11-01 → 2026-01-12**: **438**
- **Estimated page views since 2024-11-01 through 2026-01-12**: \(22.82 \times 438 \approx 9,994\)
