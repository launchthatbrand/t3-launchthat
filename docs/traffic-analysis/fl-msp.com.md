# Website Traffic Analysis — `fl-msp.com`

**Website**: `https://fl-msp.com/`  
**Inception (per request)**: **November 2024**  
**Scope**: **Domain incl. subdomains** (per provided SEO dataset)  
**Data sources**:
- Ahrefs “Organic traffic” snapshot (user-provided excerpt)
- GA4 export: `docs/fl-msp.com - page views - 7-16-2024 to 1-12-2026.csv` (Page path and screen class)

---

## What this report can and cannot claim

- **Ahrefs** numbers here represent **estimated monthly organic search traffic** (SEO), not “total visits”.
- **GA4** CSV provided is **page views by page path** for a specific date range. Page views are not the same as **sessions/visits**.
- You also referenced a GA4 “visits” PDF, but in this workspace I can’t reliably extract numbers from PDFs. If you can export **visits/sessions as CSV** (or paste the total from the PDF), I’ll include true “visits” metrics.

## Total visits since inception (Nov 2024) — best available answers

### 1) “Total” based on GA4 page views (actuals, but starts Jul 16, 2024)

- **Total GA4 page views (2024-07-16 → 2026-01-12)**: **38,920**

### 2) Estimated page views since Nov 1, 2024 (projection)

The GA4 export starts before the requested inception month. Since we only have totals for the full window (not monthly breakdown), we estimate “since Nov 2024” by prorating using the average daily page views in the window:

- Average per day in GA4 window: \(38920 / 546 \approx 71.28\)
- Days from **2024-11-01 → 2026-01-12**: **438**
- **Estimated page views since 2024-11-01 through 2026-01-12**: \(71.28 \times 438 \approx 31,222\)

If you export GA4 page views starting at **2024-11-01**, we can replace this estimate with an exact total.

### 3) Organic-only since Nov 2024 (Ahrefs estimate)

Assuming Nov 2024 → Jan 2026 inclusive = **15 months** and stable organic traffic:

- **Estimated organic visits since Nov 2024**: \(9 \times 15 = 135\)

## Notes & opportunities (based on keywords + GA4 behavior)

- **Homepage dominance**: `/` is ~83% of page views. Consider adding stronger internal linking blocks to push readers into `/resources/`, key blog posts, and program pages.
- **Search intent aligns with training + events**: keywords and top pages suggest demand around free training and major motorcycle events; keep those pages fresh and cross-link them to conversion CTAs (contact, signup, resources).
