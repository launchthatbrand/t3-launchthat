# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create PaymentForm component structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the basic structure of the PaymentForm component that will host the Authorize.Net form.
# Details:
1. Create a new file `PaymentForm.tsx` in `apps/nextjs/src/components/`
2. Import necessary React hooks (useState, useEffect)
3. Define the PaymentForm component with props for apiLoginId and clientKey
4. Create state variables for tracking payment status (loading, success, error)
5. Add placeholder for the Authorize.Net form integration
6. Export the component for use in the checkout page

# Test Strategy:
Import the component into the checkout page and verify it renders without errors. Check that props are properly typed and the component structure follows best practices.
