# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create user feedback components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement components to display success and error messages to the user after payment submission.
# Details:
1. Create a `PaymentSuccess` component that displays a confirmation message
2. Create a `PaymentError` component that displays error details and provides a retry option
3. Conditionally render these components in the PaymentForm based on the payment status
4. Include a loading state indicator during payment processing
5. Add a "Try Again" button in the error component that resets the form

# Test Strategy:
Test each feedback component in isolation with various messages. Verify they render correctly and that the retry functionality works as expected.
