# Task ID: 10
# Title: Install and Configure Authorize.Net Node.js SDK for Convex Functions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add the Authorize.Net Node.js SDK as a dependency to enable payment processing functionality within Convex functions.
# Details:
1. Add the 'authorizenet' package to the project's root package.json file by running `npm install authorizenet --save`
2. Verify the package is properly added to the dependencies section in package.json
3. Create a utility module in the project (e.g., 'lib/authorizenet.js') that initializes the SDK with appropriate configuration
4. Set up environment variables for Authorize.Net credentials (API Login ID and Transaction Key)
5. Implement a basic wrapper function that initializes the SDK with the credentials
6. Ensure the SDK is properly imported and accessible from Convex functions
7. Update any relevant documentation to note the new dependency
8. Consider implementing proper error handling for SDK initialization failures
9. Make sure to follow security best practices when handling payment credentials

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify package.json contains 'authorizenet' with the correct version in dependencies
2. Create a simple test Convex function that imports the SDK and attempts to initialize it
3. Run the test function with mock credentials to ensure it can establish a connection
4. Test error handling by intentionally using invalid credentials
5. Verify that environment variables are properly accessed and used
6. Create a sandbox transaction to test full integration (using Authorize.Net's sandbox environment)
7. Check that no credentials are hardcoded in the codebase
8. Validate that the SDK can be imported without errors in different Convex functions
9. Ensure the package doesn't conflict with other dependencies by running a full build and test suite
