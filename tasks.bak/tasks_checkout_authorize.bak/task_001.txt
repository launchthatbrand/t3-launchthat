# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up environment variables and dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the necessary environment variables and install required dependencies for the Authorize.Net integration.
# Details:
1. Add the required environment variables to the `.env` file in `apps/nextjs`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_LOGINID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_CLIENTKEY`
2. Install the `react-authorize-net` library using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   cd apps/nextjs
   npm install react-authorize-net
   ```
3. Verify the environment variables are properly loaded in the Next.js application.
4. Determine if `local-ssl-proxy` is needed for local development and install if necessary.

# Test Strategy:
Verify environment variables are accessible in the Next.js application by creating a temporary test component that logs them (ensuring they're properly prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC).
