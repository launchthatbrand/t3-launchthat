# Task ID: 9
# Title: Set up Convex Backend for WSA App
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Install and configure Convex as the backend service for the WSA application, including schema definition and provider integration.
# Details:
This task involves setting up Convex as the backend service for the WSA application:

1. Install the Convex CLI globally: `npm install -g convex`
2. Add Convex as a dependency to the WSA app: `cd apps/wsa && npm install convex`
3. Initialize Convex in the project: `npx convex dev` (this will create a `.env.local` file with your Convex credentials)
4. Create a basic schema in the generated `convex/schema.ts` file, defining initial data models needed for the application
5. Set up the Convex client in a new file at `apps/wsa/lib/convex.ts`
6. Integrate the ConvexProvider in the app's layout component (`apps/wsa/app/layout.tsx`) to make Convex available throughout the application
7. Create initial Convex functions in the `convex/` directory for basic CRUD operations
8. Update the `.env.example` file to include Convex environment variables
9. Document the Convex setup in the project README

Ensure that the Convex deployment URL is properly configured in environment variables and that the provider is correctly wrapping the application to provide Convex context to all components.

# Test Strategy:
To verify correct implementation:

1. Check that all Convex dependencies are correctly installed by reviewing package.json
2. Verify the existence of the Convex configuration files (convex.json, convex/schema.ts)
3. Confirm that the ConvexProvider is properly integrated in the app layout
4. Test the connection to Convex by creating a simple test component that queries data
5. Run a basic write operation to ensure data can be stored in Convex
6. Verify that the Convex dashboard shows the project is properly connected
7. Test the application in both development and production environments to ensure environment variables are correctly set up
8. Check that the Convex dev server can be started with `npx convex dev`
9. Verify that other developers can clone the project and set it up by following the updated README instructions
10. Ensure that the schema can be deployed without errors using `npx convex deploy`
