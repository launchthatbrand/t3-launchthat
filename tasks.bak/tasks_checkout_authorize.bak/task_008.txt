# Title: Connect PaymentForm to checkout page
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the completed PaymentForm component into the checkout page with proper props and configuration.
# Details:
1. Import the PaymentForm component into the checkout page
2. Pass the environment variables as props to the PaymentForm:
   ```tsx
   <PaymentForm
     apiLoginId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_LOGINID || ''}
     clientKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_CLIENTKEY || ''}
   />
   ```
3. Add appropriate page title and context information
4. Consider adding a simple order summary section (placeholder for future integration)
5. Implement any page-level state management if needed

# Test Strategy:
Load the checkout page and verify the PaymentForm renders correctly with all its subcomponents. Check that environment variables are properly passed to the component.
