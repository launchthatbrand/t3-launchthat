# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement payment submission handlers
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the success and error handler functions for payment submission.
# Details:
1. Implement the `onSuccessHandler` function that:
   - Updates the component state to indicate success
   - Logs the successful payment response
   - Stores any necessary payment confirmation data
2. Implement the `onErrorHandler` function that:
   - Updates the component state to indicate error
   - Captures and formats the error message from Authorize.Net
   - Logs the error details
3. Pass these handlers to the FormContainer component

# Test Strategy:
Test the handlers by mocking success and error responses. Verify the component state updates correctly and appropriate feedback is prepared for display.
