# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate react-authorize-net library
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the FormContainer and FormComponent from react-authorize-net into the PaymentForm component.
# Details:
1. Import `FormContainer` and `FormComponent` from `react-authorize-net`
2. Configure the FormContainer with the required props:
   - apiLoginId (from environment variables)
   - clientKey (from environment variables)
   - environment (set to 'sandbox')
   - onError handler function
   - onSuccess handler function
3. Implement the FormComponent within the FormContainer
4. Add necessary TypeScript interfaces/types for props and state

# Test Strategy:
Verify the FormContainer and FormComponent render correctly without errors. Check the React DevTools to ensure the components are properly nested and receiving the correct props.
