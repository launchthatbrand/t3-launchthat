# Priority: high
# Description: Create a custom React context provider for the real-time list query hook.
# Details:
Create a React context provider component that uses the useConvexRealtimeListQuery hook. Implement the same interface as Payload's default ListQueryProvider. Provide context values for list state, data, and update handlers. Handle collection-specific configurations. Ensure compatibility with Payload's ListView component.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test component that uses the provider and verify that it correctly provides context values to child components. Test integration with Payload's ListView component.
