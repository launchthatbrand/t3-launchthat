# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement production deployment workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the production deployment workflow for schema synchronization.
# Details:
Create build scripts that ensure the final schema file is generated. Implement a deployment script that runs 'convex push' before starting the application server. Set up environment-specific configuration for development and production. Create documentation for the production deployment workflow.

# Test Strategy:
Test the production deployment workflow by simulating a production build and deployment. Verify that the schema is correctly pushed to Convex before the application starts.
