# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial project structure for the Payload CMS + Convex integration, including the plugin and database adapter packages.
# Details:
Create the following directory structure:
- packages/payloadplugins/convexPlugin/
- packages/payloadplugins/convexDbAdapter/
Initialize package.json files for both packages with appropriate dependencies including payload, convex, and necessary type definitions. Set up TypeScript configuration. Create README files with basic descriptions of each package's purpose.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project structure is correctly set up and all dependencies can be installed without errors. Ensure TypeScript compilation works without errors.
