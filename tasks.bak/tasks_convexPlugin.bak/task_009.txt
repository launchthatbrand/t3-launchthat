# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop functionality to handle relationships between collections in the database adapter.
# Details:
Implement population of relationship fields in the find and findOne methods. Handle both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Support nested populations. Create utility functions for resolving relationship references. Optimize relationship queries to minimize database operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases with related collections and verify that relationship fields are correctly populated. Test nested relationships and verify that circular references are handled correctly.
