# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement query translation for Payload where clauses
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to translate Payload's query syntax to Convex query parameters.
# Details:
Create a query translator that converts Payload's where clauses to Convex query parameters. Handle operators like equals, in, not_in, like, contains, etc. Support nested conditions and logical operators (and, or). Create utility functions for building Convex queries based on translated parameters. Handle pagination, sorting, and limiting of results.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases with various query combinations and verify that they are correctly translated to Convex queries. Test complex queries with nested conditions and multiple operators.
