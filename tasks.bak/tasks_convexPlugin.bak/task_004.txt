# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Payload config parsing in convexPlugin
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the functionality to parse Payload's configuration to extract collection and field definitions.
# Details:
Implement a function that extracts collection definitions from the Payload config. Create parsers for different field types to map them to appropriate Convex types. Handle nested fields and arrays. Create a data structure to represent the parsed configuration that will be used for schema generation. Implement validation to ensure the parsed configuration is valid for Convex schema generation.

# Test Strategy:
Create test Payload configs with various collection and field types. Verify that the parsing function correctly extracts all collections and fields with their properties.
