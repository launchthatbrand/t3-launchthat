# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Convex schema generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the functionality to generate a Convex schema file based on the parsed Payload configuration.
# Details:
Create a function that generates Convex schema code based on the parsed Payload configuration. Map Payload field types to appropriate Convex field types (v.*). Generate table definitions for each collection. Handle relationships between collections. Generate appropriate indexes based on field configurations. Create a file writer that outputs the generated schema to convex/schema.ts.

# Test Strategy:
Generate schemas for test Payload configs and verify that the generated schema is valid Convex schema code. Test that the schema can be successfully pushed to a Convex development instance.
