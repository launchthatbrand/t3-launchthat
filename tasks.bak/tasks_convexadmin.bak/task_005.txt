# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Convex client integration for Next.js
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the PayloadProvider in packages/convexcms/ui/src/providers to ConvexCmsProvider, implement schema parsing to generate convexadmin.config.ts and convexadmin.importMap.ts in the target app's .generated directory, and integrate these generated files into the provider.
# Details:
Refactor the PayloadProvider in packages/convexcms/ui/src/providers to create ConvexCmsProvider with the following changes:
1. Rename PayloadProvider to ConvexCmsProvider for the root layout level integration
2. Implement schema parsing functionality to automatically generate convexadmin.config.ts and convexadmin.importMap.ts in the target application's .generated directory
3. Modify the provider to properly initialize and use these generated configuration files
4. Ensure that Convex queries and mutations can be used throughout the application
5. Configure proper error handling for Convex operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the renamed ConvexCmsProvider works correctly at the root layout level
2. Test the schema parsing functionality to ensure it correctly generates convexadmin.config.ts and convexadmin.importMap.ts in the .generated directory
3. Confirm that the generated files are properly integrated with the provider
4. Test basic Convex operations (query, mutation) to verify that the integration is working correctly
5. Verify error handling for various Convex operation scenarios
