# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Add Convex query integration to fetch data for list views
# Details:
Implement data fetching using Convex useQuery in the ListView component. Create a generic query function that can fetch records from any Convex table based on the collection name. Handle loading states, errors, and empty results. Implement basic pagination if possible.

# Test Strategy:
Test data fetching with various collections. Verify that the data is displayed correctly and that loading states and errors are handled properly.
