# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement basic authentication integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add support for Convex authentication in the admin panel
# Details:
Integrate with Convex authentication to secure the admin panel. Implement login/logout functionality. Add basic access control to ensure only authenticated users can access the admin panel. Use Convex's auth mechanisms rather than Payload's original authentication system.

# Test Strategy:
Test login, logout, and accessing protected routes with and without authentication. Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
