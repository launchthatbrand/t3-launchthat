# Task ID: 4
# Title: Identify and comment out non-essential Payload features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically review and comment out non-core features in the Payload codebase
# Details:
Review the @convexcms/* packages and identify code related to non-core features. Comment out this code using a consistent marker (e.g., // TODO: CONVEX_REFACTOR_PHASE_3). Focus on authentication, access control, GraphQL, hooks, versioning, drafts, internationalization, and complex field types. Provide minimal mocks (empty functions or functions returning null/Promise.resolve()) where necessary for the application to compile and run.

# Test Strategy:
Ensure the application still compiles after commenting out code. Verify that basic functionality remains intact.
