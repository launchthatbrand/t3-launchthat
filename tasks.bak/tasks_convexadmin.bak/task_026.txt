# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Real-time ListView with Convex Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Override Payload's ListQueryProvider to use a custom hook that fetches data directly from Convex, enabling real-time updates in the native ListView component.
# Details:
Create a custom hook called `useConvexRealtimeListQuery` that will replace Payload's default data fetching mechanism for ListViews. The implementation should:

1. Create a wrapper component that overrides Payload's `ListQueryProvider` to inject our custom hook
2. Develop the `useConvexRealtimeListQuery` hook that:
   - Manages filter, sort, and pagination state (syncing with URL parameters)
   - Translates this state into appropriate Convex query arguments
   - Uses Convex's `useQuery` hook to fetch data with real-time updates
   - Transforms the Convex query results to match Payload's expected data structure: `{ docs: [], totalDocs: number, page: number, totalPages: number, hasPrevPage: boolean, hasNextPage: boolean }`
   - Provides handlers for updating state (changing page, sort, filters, etc.)

3. Ensure the hook properly handles loading states and errors
4. Implement URL synchronization so that filter/sort/pagination state is reflected in the URL and can be bookmarked/shared
5. Add appropriate TypeScript types for all components and hooks
6. Register the component override in the Payload config to replace the default ListView provider

The implementation should be non-intrusive to Payload's core components, only overriding the data fetching layer while preserving all existing ListView functionality and appearance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the `useConvexRealtimeListQuery` hook:
   - Test that it correctly translates filter/sort/pagination state to Convex query arguments
   - Test that it properly transforms Convex results to match Payload's expected structure
   - Test URL synchronization functionality
   - Mock Convex's `useQuery` to simulate different response scenarios

2. Integration testing:
   - Create a test collection in Payload with the custom provider enabled
   - Verify that the ListView renders correctly with initial data
   - Test real-time updates by modifying data in Convex and confirming the UI updates without refresh
   - Test all filtering, sorting, and pagination controls work as expected
   - Verify URL parameters update correctly when changing filters/sort/page
   - Test that navigating directly to a URL with filter/sort/page parameters loads the correct data

3. Performance testing:
   - Compare rendering performance with the standard ListView
   - Test with large datasets to ensure pagination works efficiently
   - Verify that real-time updates don't cause unnecessary re-renders

4. Cross-browser testing to ensure compatibility
