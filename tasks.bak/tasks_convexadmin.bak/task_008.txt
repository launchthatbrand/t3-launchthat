# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create ListView component generator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a mechanism to generate list views for each collection
# Details:
Create a component that generates a list view for a given collection based on the schema. The component should include a table with columns for each field in the schema. Use existing UI components from @convexcms/ui or @acme/ui. Include links to the EditView for each record. Focus on basic functionality without complex features like filtering or sorting.

# Test Strategy:
Test the generated list views with different collection schemas. Verify that the table displays correctly and that links to edit views work.
