# Description: Develop a client component for rendering frontend content
# Details:
Create a client component (FrontendRootPage) that accepts the analyzed Convex config/schema structure and segments. Implement basic logic to render content dynamically based on the segments, potentially fetching data from Convex using useQuery. Start with a simple implementation that can be expanded later.

# Test Strategy:
Test rendering with various segment patterns. Verify that the component correctly interprets the segments and renders appropriate content.
