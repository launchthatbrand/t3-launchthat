# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop dynamic collection routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement routing within the admin panel based on the Convex schema
# Details:
Create dynamic routes for collections (/admin/[collectionSlug]) and documents (/admin/[collectionSlug]/[documentId]). Implement route handlers that load the appropriate components based on the URL parameters. Ensure that the routes are properly typed and validated against the schema.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between different collections and documents. Verify that the correct components are loaded for each route.
