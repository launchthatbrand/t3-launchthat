# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Next.js application within the monorepo structure and configure essential dependencies
# Details:
1. Create the Next.js application in the `apps/mondayclone` directory
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up the connection to Shadcn UI components from the local `packages/ui` package
4. Configure ESLint and Prettier
5. Set up the basic project structure with directories for components, hooks, utils, and types
6. Initialize a state management solution (recommend Zustand for its simplicity and effectiveness with this type of application)

```bash
# Navigate to the apps directory
cd apps

# Create Next.js app with App Router
npx create-next-app@latest mondayclone --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app

# Configure package.json to use the local UI package
# Add to dependencies: "@ui": "workspace:*"
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the application builds without errors and the development server starts correctly. Confirm that Shadcn UI components can be imported and rendered properly from the local package.
