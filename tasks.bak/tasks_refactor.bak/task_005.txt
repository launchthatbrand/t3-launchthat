# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Shared Utility Functions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a shared utilities directory and implement common helper functions
# Details:
1. Create a shared/ or utils/ directory at the root of convex/.
2. Implement utility functions for common operations (e.g., pagination, validation helpers).
3. Create a constants.ts file for shared constants across features.
4. Implement getAuthenticatedUserId helper to standardize user authentication.
5. Use TypeScript for strong typing and consider using utility types from @convex-dev/server.
6. Export utilities through an index.ts file for easy importing.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each utility function using a testing framework compatible with Convex (e.g., Jest with appropriate mocking of Convex context).
