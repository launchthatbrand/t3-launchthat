# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Consistent Use of TypeScript and Convex Validators
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure consistent and correct use of TypeScript types and Convex validators across all functions
# Details:
1. Review and update all function signatures to use proper TypeScript types.
2. Ensure consistent use of Convex types (e.g., Doc, Id) from @convex-dev/server.
3. Implement or update args and returns validators for all Convex functions.
4. Use v.union() for fields that can have multiple types.
5. Implement custom validators for complex data structures if needed.
6. Ensure null checks are properly handled, using v.optional() where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Use TypeScript compiler in strict mode to catch type errors. Develop unit tests that pass various valid and invalid inputs to each function to verify proper validation.
