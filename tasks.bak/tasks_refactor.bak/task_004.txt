# Task ID: 4
# Title: Refactor Schema Definitions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Move and reorganize schema definitions into feature-specific directories
# Details:
1. Identify all schema definitions in the current structure.
2. Move schema definitions to their respective feature directories (e.g., ecommerce/schema/, users/users.schema.ts).
3. Update the main schema.ts to import and aggregate schemas from feature-specific files.
4. Ensure all schema definitions follow Convex best practices, including appropriate indexing.
5. Use the latest Convex SDK version (currently @convex-dev/server@0.3.0) for schema definitions.

# Test Strategy:
Run Convex schema validation commands. Ensure all existing queries and mutations still work with the new schema structure.
