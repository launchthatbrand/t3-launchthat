# Task ID: 14
# Title: Refactor Content Management System (CMS) Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor CMS related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create cms/ directory with files for posts and potentially other content types.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to appropriate files.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common CMS logic into shared helper functions in cms/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.
7. Use Convex's search capabilities for content discovery if applicable.

# Test Strategy:
Develop integration tests for content creation, editing, publishing, and retrieval. Verify proper handling of different content types and search functionality.
