# Title: Refactor Groups and Posts Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor group and post related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create groups/ directory with files for groups and posts.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to appropriate files.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common group and post logic into shared helper functions in groups/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.
7. Use Convex's pagination helpers for efficient list queries.

# Test Strategy:
Develop integration tests covering group creation, joining, posting, and retrieval operations. Ensure proper handling of permissions and pagination.
