# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Consistent Error Handling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish and apply consistent error handling patterns across all modules
# Details:
1. Create a shared error handling utility in the shared/ directory.
2. Define custom error classes for different types of errors (e.g., ValidationError, NotFoundError, PermissionError).
3. Implement a centralized error logging mechanism.
4. Update all functions to use the new error handling utilities.
5. Ensure all errors provide informative messages suitable for debugging.
6. Implement proper error translation for client-side consumption.

# Test Strategy:
Develop a comprehensive test suite that triggers various error conditions across all modules. Verify that errors are consistently handled and properly logged.
