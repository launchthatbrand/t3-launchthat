# Task ID: 8
# Title: Refactor Learning Management System (LMS) Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor LMS related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create lms/ directory with files for courses, topics, and enrollments.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to appropriate files.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common LMS logic into shared helper functions in lms/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Develop integration tests covering key LMS flows (course creation, enrollment, progress tracking). Verify that all existing LMS functionality remains intact.
