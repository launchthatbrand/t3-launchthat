# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive testing suite covering all refactored modules
# Details:
1. Set up a testing framework compatible with Convex (e.g., Jest with appropriate mocking).
2. Develop unit tests for all utility functions and helpers.
3. Create integration tests covering key flows in each module (e.g., user registration, product purchase, course enrollment).
4. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys.
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically on each commit.
6. Ensure proper mocking of Convex context and database operations in tests.
7. Aim for high test coverage, particularly for core business logic.
8. Document the testing strategy and how to run tests locally.

# Test Strategy:
Run the entire test suite and verify that all tests pass. Use a code coverage tool to ensure adequate coverage across all modules.
