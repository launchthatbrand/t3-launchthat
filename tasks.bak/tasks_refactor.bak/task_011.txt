# Task ID: 11
# Title: Refactor Downloads Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor download related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create downloads/ directory with downloads.ts and downloads.schema.ts.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to downloads.ts.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common download logic into shared helper functions in downloads/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.
7. Use Convex's file storage API for managing downloadable files if applicable.

# Test Strategy:
Develop tests for download creation, retrieval, and access control. Verify proper handling of large files and concurrent downloads.
