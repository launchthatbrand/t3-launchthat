# Task ID: 7
# Title: Refactor E-commerce Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor e-commerce related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create ecommerce/ directory with subdirectories for cart, checkout, orders, products, and variations.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to appropriate files.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common e-commerce logic into shared helper functions in ecommerce/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.

# Test Strategy:
Develop a set of integration tests covering key e-commerce flows (add to cart, checkout, order placement). Ensure all existing functionality remains intact.
