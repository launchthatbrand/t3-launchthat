# Description: Update frontend code to reflect changes in Convex function paths and names
# Details:
1. Identify all places in the frontend code (apps/portal/src/) where Convex functions are called.
2. Update import statements to reflect the new directory structure.
3. Update function names in useQuery, useMutation, and useAction hooks.
4. Ensure all TypeScript types used in the frontend are updated to match backend changes.
5. Update any hardcoded strings referring to Convex function paths.
6. Verify that all Convex client interactions are using the latest patterns and best practices.

# Test Strategy:
Run the frontend build process to catch any TypeScript errors. Manually test all major frontend flows to ensure proper communication with the refactored backend.
