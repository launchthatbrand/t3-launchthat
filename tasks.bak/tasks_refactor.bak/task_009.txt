# Task ID: 9
# Title: Refactor User Management Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Reorganize and refactor user management related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create users/ directory with users.ts and users.schema.ts.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to users.ts.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common user management logic into shared helper functions in users/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.
7. Ensure all user-related operations use the standardized authentication and authorization helpers.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for user management operations (create, read, update, delete). Verify proper handling of edge cases and error conditions.
