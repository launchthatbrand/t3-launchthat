# Title: Refactor Calendar Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reorganize and refactor calendar and event related functions into the new structure
# Details:
1. Create calendar/ directory with files for calendar and events.
2. Move relevant queries, mutations, and actions to appropriate files.
3. Update internal references (api.*, internal.*) to reflect new file locations.
4. Extract common calendar logic into shared helper functions in calendar/lib/.
5. Ensure consistent use of TypeScript types and Convex validators.
6. Implement proper error handling with specific, informative error messages.
7. Use efficient querying techniques for date-based data retrieval.

# Test Strategy:
Develop integration tests for event creation, retrieval, and calendar views. Ensure proper handling of time zones and recurring events if applicable.
